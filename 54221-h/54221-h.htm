<h2 id="PREFACE_TO_THE_SECOND_EDITION">PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION.</h2>
</div>

<p>The great favor with which the first
edition of this little work has been received
and the steadily growing interest in its
subject, together with many valuable improvements
and researches, may be given
as the reasons for this new edition.</p>

<p>The book has been thoroughly revised,
partly rewritten, and considerable new matter,
with twenty-six new illustrations, added.
It has been brought up to date as far as electrical
science has gone.</p>

<p>To detail all that has been done is too
great a task for a preface; we may briefly
mention the following new matter:</p>

<p>Coils for gas and automobile engines;
medical coils, concise directions for operation
and repairs; new forms of contact
breakers, including electrolytic and mechani<span class="pagenum" id="Page_iv">iv</span>cal;
gas-lighting apparatus; primary and
secondary batteries.</p>

<p>The chapter on X-Ray Apparatus has
been entirely rewritten, and is thoroughly
practical; and an entire chapter on Wireless
Telegraphy has been added. In a book of
this size it is not feasible to give specific
directions and full dimensions for the manufacture
of all the apparatus described.
Indeed, much of the latter must be adapted
to the particular purpose for which it is to
be utilized. Again, the same amount of
material will not always produce the same
results. A little closer winding, greater
pressure applied to the cooling wax of a
condenser, and the output or capacity of
either is changed.</p>

<p>Matters purely of design or taste are to
be governed by the creative faculty of the
worker; but such general details and rules
are given as will be sufficient to enable one
possessing ordinary constructive ability to
make his own apparatus.</p>

<p>The whole process of coil-making does<span class="pagenum" id="Page_v">v</span>
not require high mechanical skill, but chiefly
patience and attention to details; and, perhaps
best of all, but few tools are needed,
all of a simple kind.</p>

<p>We beg to acknowledge courtesies received
from Messrs. Queen &amp; Co., the
<i>Scientific American</i> for frontispiece and
Fig. 13, Mr. Goldingham's book on Oil
Engines for Fig. 12, and others who have
been of assistance to the author. The best
American and English practice has been
adopted; the American standard gauges and
sizes of wires are used, except where noted.</p>

<p>A list of works, particularly of value to
the coil worker, will be found following the
index.</p>

<small>COIL CONSTRUCTION.</small></h2>
</div>

<p>In commencing a description of the
Ruhmkorff coil and its uses, a brief mention
of the fundamental laws of induction
directly bearing on its action will assist in
obtaining an intelligent conception of the
proper manner in which it should be constructed
and handled.</p>

<p>Any variation or cessation of a current
of electricity flowing in one conductor will
induce a momentary current in an adjacent
conductor; and if the second conductor
be an insulated wire coiled around
the first conductor, also a coil of insulated
wire, the effect is heightened. The intensity
of the secondary or induced current
increases with the number of turns of
its conductor, the abruptness and com<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">2</span>pleteness
of the variation of current in the
first or primary coil, and the proximity of
the coils. And the insertion of a mass of
soft iron within the primary coil by its
consequent magnetization and demagnetization
augments still further the inductive
effect. There are other contributing
causes which cannot be treated of here,
but are of not so much importance as the
foregoing.</p>

<p>In the Ruhmkorff coil, which is an application
of the above laws, the primary
coil is of large wire and the secondary coil
of extremely fine wire, of a length many
thousand times greater than the wire of
the primary coil. The current is abruptly
broken in the primary circuit by a suitable
device—the contact breaker or rheotome.
The current induced in the secondary at
the make of the circuit is in the opposite
direction to that of the primary coil and
battery, but the current at the break of
the circuit is in the same direction as that
of the primary. The effect of the current<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">3</span>
at the break of the circuit is more powerful
than that at the make, which latter is
also somewhat neutralized by the opposing
battery current. A condenser or Leyden
jar is connected across the contact
breaker to absorb an <i>extra current</i> induced
in the primary coil by the break of the circuit,
which would tend to prolong the magnetization
of the core beyond the desired
limit.</p>

<p>The whole apparatus is mounted on a
wood base, having the condenser in a false
bottom for the sake of compactness.</p>

<p>It is not herein intended to describe all
the minor operations in the construction
of a Ruhmkorff coil. A sufficient description
and review of the main points to be
considered, however, will be given to enable
a person fairly proficient in the use of simple
tools to construct a serviceable instrument.</p>

<p>The parts and their arrangement in relation
to one another are shown in Fig. 1,
but are not drawn strictly to scale, although
very nearly so.</p>

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 1.</span></div>
</div>

<p><i>C</i> is the core, consisting of a bundle of
soft iron wires as fine as can be obtained.
The greater the subdivision of the core the
quicker will it respond to the magnetizing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">5</span>
current in the primary coil, and lose its
magnetism when the current ceases. It
has another advantage, in that the disadvantageous
eddy, or Foucault currents,
are lessened, which fact, however, is of
not enough importance to need extended
consideration.</p>

<p>Many coil-makers saturate the core with
paraffin or shellac, which is of slight benefit.
This core is wrapped in an insulating
layer of paraffined paper or enclosed in a
rubber shell, there not being any great
necessity to use more than ordinary insulation
between the core and the primary
coil.</p>

<p>In the majority of induction coils or
"transformers" used in the alternating
current system of electric lighting, the
iron cores form a closed magnetic circuit.
A closed magnetic circuit in a Ruhmkorff
coil could be obtained by extending the
iron core at each end and then bending
and securing the ends together, forming,
as it were, a ring partly inside and partly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">6</span>
outside the coil. But although the inductive
effects would be heightened and less
battery power required, the slowness of
the circuit to demagnetize would alone be
detrimental to rapid oscillations of current.</p>

<p>There would also be a loss from a greater
hysteresis (energy lost in the magnetization
and demagnetization of iron). A
core magnetizes quicker than it demagnetizes,
and the latter is rarely complete;
a certain amount of residual magnetism
remains, hysteresis being strictly due to
this retention of energy (Sprague). Hysteresis
shows itself in heat, but must not
be confounded with Foucault or eddy currents.
The latter are corrected by subdividing
the metal, but the former depends
upon the quality of the metal, and increases
with its length.</p>

<p>Moreover, a coil with a closed magnetic
circuit requires an independent contact
breaker.</p>

<p>In most of the alternating currents used
in lighting their rapidity of alternation is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">7</span>
but one hundred and twenty-five periods
per second. As in the simple electromagnet,
the proportions of diameter and
length of the primary coil and core will
determine its rapidity of action. A short
fat coil and core will act much quicker
than a long thin one. But on a short fat
coil the outside turns would be too far
removed from the intensest part of the
primary field. A good proportion of core
length is given in the following table:</p>

<p>The primary coil <i>P</i> consists of two or
not more than three layers of insulated
copper wire of large diameter, being required
to carry a heavy current in a 2-inch
spark coil, probably from 8 to 10 amperes.
In designing the primary coil a great ad<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">8</span>vantage
arises from using comparatively
few turns but of large wire. Each turn of
wire in the primary has a choking effect
upon its neighbor by what is termed self-induction.</p>

<p>As the primary coil and core may be
considered as an electro magnet, it may
not be out of place to notice the rule governing
such. Magnetization of an iron
core is mainly dependent upon the ampere
turns of the coil surrounding it—that is,
one ampere carried around the core for
one hundred turns (100 ampere-turns)
would equal in effect ten amperes flowing
through ten turns. Practically speaking,
there would be certain variations to the
rule, for one difficulty would arise in that
the smaller wire used in conveying the
smaller current would fit more compactly
and allow more turns to be nearer the
core, the active effect of the turns always
decreasing with their distance from the
core. And although a large current and
few turns would not have so much self<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">9</span>-induction,
there would be trouble at the
contact breaker, owing to the large current
it would have to control.</p>

<p>The most suitable sizes of wire for the
primary coil are: No. 16 B. &amp; S. for
coils up to 1 inch spark; No. 14 B. &amp; S.
up to 4 inches of spark, and No. 12 B.
&amp; S. for a 6-inch spark coil. The coil
should be, say, one-twelfth of the core
length shorter than the core.</p>

<p><i>I</i> is the insulating tube between the primary
coil and the secondary coil <i>S</i>. Here
great precaution is necessary to prevent
any liability of short circuiting or breaking
through of sparks from the secondary coil.
This danger cannot be underestimated,
and the tube should be either of glass or
hard rubber, free from flaws, varying in
thickness with the dimensions of the coil.
It should extend at least one-tenth of the
total length of the primary coil beyond it
at each end. The end of this tube can be
turned down so as to allow of the hard
rubber reel ends being slipped on and held<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span>
in position by outside hard rubber rings
(Fig. 2).</p>

<div class="figcenter" ><a id="fig2"></a>
<img src="images/i_010.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 2.</span></div>
</div>

<p>The secondary coil consists of many
turns of fine insulated copper wire separated
from the primary coil by the insulating
tube and a liberal amount of insulating
compound at each end. In coils giving
under 1 inch of spark this coil may be
wound in two or more sections.</p>

<div class="figcenter" ><a id="fig3"></a>
<img src="images/i_011.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 3.</span></div>
</div>

<p>The usual manner of constructing these<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">11</span>
sections is to divide up the space on the
insulating tube by means of hard rubber
rings placed at equal distances apart, in
number according to the number of sections
desired (Fig. 3). The space between
each set of rings, or between the coil end
and a ring, is wound with the wire selected,
the filled sections constituting a number
of complete coils, which are finally connected
in series. The sectional method of
winding prevents the liability of the spark
jumping through a short circuit, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span>
heightens its tendency to pass into the primary
coil at the ends, where it must be
therefore specially insulated from it.</p>

<div class="figcenter" ><a id="fig4"></a>
<img src="images/i_012.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 4.</span></div>
</div>

<p>In winding these sections there is a
method now generally adopted which has
many good points, although at first it may
seem complicated. The old way of filling
two sections was to wind both in the same<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span>
direction as full as desired, then join the
outside end of the left-hand coil to the inside
end of the right-hand coil. This
necessitated bringing the outside end
down between two disks, or in a vertical
hole in the sectional divider, and thereby
rendered it liable to spark through into its
own coil. This is shown in Fig. 4, <i>A</i> and
<i>C</i> inside ends, <i>B</i> and <i>D</i> outside ends, the
disk being between <i>B</i> and <i>C</i>.</p>

<div class="figcenter" ><a id="fig5"></a>
<img src="images/i_013.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 5.</span></div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span></p>

<p>Reference to Fig. 3 shows the new
method, and Fig. 5 shows an enlarged
diagram of sections 2 and 3 of Fig. 3.</p>

<p>Sections 1 and 3, Fig. 3, are filled with
as many turns as desired; the spool is
then turned end for end, and sections 2
and 4 are wound, being thus in the opposite
direction of winding to sections 1
and 3.</p>

<p>The inside ends of 1 and 2 and 3 and 4
are soldered together, and the outside
ends of 2 and 3 are also soldered together.</p>

<p>The outside ends of 1 and 4 serve as terminals
for the coil.</p>

<p>This method of connection leaves all the
turns so joined that the current circulates
in the same direction through them all, as
will be seen by an examination of the enlarged
diagram, Fig. 5.</p>

<p>Sprague, in his "Electricity: Its Theory,
Sources, and Application," recommends
that the turns of wire in the secondary
coil shall gradually increase in
number until the middle of the spool is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span>
reached, and then decrease to the spool
end, in order that the greatest number of
turns be in the strongest part of the magnetic
field (see Fig. 6). <i>D D D</i> are section
dividers, <i>S</i> secondary windings, <i>P</i> primary
coil. The selection of the size of wire to
be used depends on the requirements as
to the spark. If a short thick spark be
desired, use a thick wire, say No. 34 B.
&amp; S.; if a long thin one, use No. 36 to
No. 40 B. &amp; S.</p>

<p>Although it is impossible to lay down<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span>
rules for determining the exact amount of
wire to be used to obtain a certain sized
spark, yet a fair average is to allow
1¼ pounds No. 36 B. &amp; S. per inch spark
for small coils and slightly less for large
ones.</p>

<p>The most satisfactory and perhaps the
easiest way for large coils is to wind the
secondary in separate coils, made in a
manner similar to that employed in winding
coils for the Thompson reflecting galvanometer.
This method, first described
by Mr. F. C. Alsop in his treatise on
"Induction Coils," is somewhat as follows:</p>


<p>A special piece of apparatus (Figs. 7 and
8) is necessary, but presents no great difficulty
in manufacture. A metal disk, <i>D</i>, one-sixth
of an inch thick and 7 inches in diameter,
is mounted on the shaft <i>S</i>. A second
disk is provided with a collar and set
screw, <i>A</i>, in order that it may be adjusted
on the shaft at any desired distance from
the stationary one. When the diameter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span>
of the coil to be wound has been decided<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span>
upon, a wooden collar, <i>W</i>, with a bevelled
surface is slipped on the shaft, it corresponding
in diameter with the desired
diameter of the hole through the centre of
the secondary coil. As these coils are
going to be made as flat
rings and slipped on over
the insulating tube, a remark
here becomes necessary
on this diameter.
Reference to Fig. 9 will
show that it is intended
that the coils near the
reel ends shall fit very
loosely on the tube <i>T</i>
(Fig. 1)—in fact, that
there shall be a clearance of possibly
one-half inch in the extreme end, diminishing
gradually to a fifteenth of an inch in
the centre coils. Therefore it becomes
necessary to provide a number of wooden
rings equal to the desired diameter of the
central hole in the coil. The thickness of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span>
the wood determining the width of the individual
coil depends on the selection of
the operator; but the rule may be laid
down that the narrower the coils the better
the insulation of the complete coil will
be on completion.</p>

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 9.</span></div>
</div>

<p>One-sixteenth of an inch is a very fair
average, and has been generally adopted
by the writer.</p>

<p>A quantity of paper rings are now cut
out of stout writing paper which has been
soaked in melted paraffin. If a block or
pad of letter paper be soaked in paraffin
and allowed to become cold under pressure,
the ring may be scratched on the surface
of it and the block cut through on a
jig saw. The central apertures of course
will vary in size with their position on the
tube <i>T</i> (Fig. 9).</p>

<p>The coil winder is now either mounted
in a lathe or fixed in a hand magnet winder
in such manner that it can be steadily and
rapidly rotated. The wire to be wound
comes on spools, which can be so threaded<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span>
on a piece of metal rod that they turn
readily. A metal dish containing melted
paraffin is provided with a round rod,
preferably of glass, fixed under the paraffin
surface, so that it can rotate freely when
the wire passes under it through the
paraffin. Two paper rings are slipped on
the winder that they may form, as it were,
reel ends for the coil, and if the metal
disks have been warmed it is an easy matter
to lay them flat.</p>

<p>The end of the wire is then passed
through the paraffin under the glass rod
and through the hole <i>H</i> in the metal disk
for a distance of, say, 6 inches, and held to
the disk outside with a dab of paraffin or
beeswax. Then the winder is rotated
and the space between the paper disks is
filled with wire. The paraffin, being hot,
will adhere to the wire, and cooling as the
wire lays down on the winder, hold the
turns together and at the same time insulate
them from each other. It will not be
possible to lay the wire in even layers, as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span>
would be necessary in winding a wider
coil, but the spaces can be filled up, using
ordinary care that no radical irregularity
occurs—that is, that only adjacent layers
are likely to commingle.</p>

<p>When the space is filled up to the level
of the paper disks and the paraffin is hard,
loosen the set screw, and removing the
outside disk, the coil can be slipped off, or
a slight warming will loosen it. Any
number of these coils can be made, and
there are the advantages in this mode of
construction that a bad coil will not spoil
the whole secondary, and that the wire
can be obtained in comparatively small
quantities.</p>

<p>As each coil will not be of very high resistance,
the continuity of the wire can be
readily tested by means of a few cells of
battery, connecting one end of the coil to
one pole of the battery, and the other pole
of the battery and coil end touched to the
tongue. If a burning sensation is experienced,
the connection is not broken.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span>
Where possible the coils should be measured
as to their resistance on a Wheatstone
bridge.</p>

<p>When the requisite number of coils has
been prepared, they are assembled in the
following manner (Fig. 9): The coils, having
their aperture diameter graded, are
placed in order, and starting with the one
having the largest hole, it is slipped over
the primary protection tube <i>T</i>, one end
being brought out through a hole in the
reel end drilled vertically or between the
reel end and the coil. A couple of paper
rings are then slipped on the tube, and another
coil placed over them, having its
ends connected as in Fig. 3. This process
is continued until all the coils are in place.
The annular space between the coils and
the tube <i>T</i> (Fig. 9) is filled in with melted
paraffin and the coils gently pressed together,
so as to form a compact mass,
paraffin being poured over the outside of
the whole combination. Before winding
any wire used in this work it must be per<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span>fectly
dry, which end can be accomplished
by subjecting the whole spool to a short
period of baking in a moderately warm
oven.</p>

<p>The accompanying table gives the
length of No. 36 silk-covered wire that
will fill a linear space equal to one thickness
of the wire in different-sized rings.
This size wire wound tight will give 125
turns per linear inch. Therefore on a ring
having a middle aperture of 1½ inches and an
outside diameter of 4 inches, there will be
156 turns, or a total length of 1347 inches.
This is obtained as follows: 1½ inches ×
3.1416 = 4.7124 (or 4.712); 4 inches ×
3.1416 = 12.5664 (or 12.56); (4.712 + 12.56)∕2
= mean circumference—viz., 8.635 inches.</p>

<p>This mean × number of turns in thickness
of ring between the two circumferences—viz.,
156 = 1347 inches.</p>

<p>To obtain the length of wire necessary
for a ring occupying more than the space
of one turn on the primary insulating tube,
multiply the length before obtained by the
number of turns in the space it occupies.
Thus a flat ring one-tenth of an inch thick
would equal 1347 inches × 12.5.</p>

<p>This rule is necessarily only approximate,
owing to the way the wires bed on
each other from their cylindrical section.
In actual practice, when the wire is run
through the paraffin bath not more than
50 per cent of the calculated wire will occupy
the space. And the thickness of the
paper rings must also be added when figuring
the total length of the coil. In the
iron-clad transformers or induction coils of
highest efficiency used in the alternating
current electric light system, the rule for
determining the windings of the coils is
based on the ratio of the turns of wire in
the primary to the turns in the secondary,
the electromotive force in the primary, and
the lines of force cut by the windings.</p>

<p>The secondary ends can be attached to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span>binding posts mounted on the reel ends.
Unless these reel ends be very high and
clear the outside of the coil considerably,
it is better to mount the binding posts on
the top of the hard rubber pillars. A neat
plan is to mount on the top of the coil a
hard rubber plate reaching from reel end
to reel end, and place the binding posts on
that.</p>

<p>A discharger consists of two sliding
metal rods with insulated handles passing
through pillars attached to the secondary
coil. The inside ends of these rods is provided
with screw threads for the ready
attachment of the balls, points, etc., which
are to be used. The substance to be acted
upon is laid on a rubber or glass table
midway between the rod pillars and
slightly below the level of the rods.</p>

<p>By hinging the rod pillars, or using a
ball and socket joint, the discharger can
be inclined so as to be better brought near
the substance on the table.</p>

<p>The next important part of the coil is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span>the contact breaker.</p>

<p>The armature <i>R</i> is a piece of soft iron
carried at the end of a stiff spring, in about
the middle of which, at <i>B</i>, is riveted a small
platinum disk or stud. The adjusting
screw <i>A</i> has its point also furnished with a
piece of platinum, which is intended to
touch the platinum on the spring when the
latter is in its normal position. The core
<i>C</i> of the coil serves as an electro-magnet.
When the current flows from the battery
(represented by the figure at <i>L</i>) through
the primary coil and armature spring to
the adjusting screw, it causes the armature
to be drawn to the magnetized core, but
thereby draws the platinum disk away
from the adjusting screw. In so doing it
breaks the circuit, the magnet loses its
power, and the elasticity of the spring reasserting
itself, carries the armature back,
thereby reclosing the circuit. This is repeated
many times in a second, the result
being a continual vibration of the spring,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span>and a consequent interruption to the current.</p>

<p>The condenser or Leyden jar <i>J</i>, connected
as in the diagram to the base of the vibrating
spring at <i>K</i> and to the adjusting screw
wire <i>M</i>, is constructed as follows: On a
sheet of insulated paper is laid a smaller
sheet of tinfoil, one edge of which projects
an inch or so over one end of the paper.
Another sheet of paper covering this carries
a second sheet of tinfoil, one end of
which projects as in the first sheet, but at
the opposite end of the paper. Tinfoil
and paper sheets are laid in this manner
alternately until a sufficient number is attained.
The projecting ends are then
clamped together and the whole pile immersed
in melted paraffin, as will be described
in a subsequent chapter. Wires
are affixed to these clamped ends which
serve to connect the condenser with the
contact breaker. The conventional sign
for a condenser is that used at <i>J</i>, showing
the two series of plates, the insulation or
dielectric, as it is called, being understood.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span>The size of condenser to use with different-sized
coils varies according to the
winding of the primary and the battery
used. A primary coil of few turns would
not necessitate as large a condenser as one
of a large number of turns. At the same
time, a condenser may be made of too
great a capacity, and thereby weaken the
action of the coil.</p>

<p>The base upon which the coil and its
parts are mounted may be of dried polished
wood. But where the coil is designed
to give large sparks—over 2
inches—it is an advantage to use hard rubber
one quarter of an inch and upward in
thickness. Glass, were it not for the difficulty
of drilling it and its brittleness,
would be a desirable material for a coil
base in a dry atmosphere. Hard red or
black fibre coated with shellac varnish is
also serviceable, and, moreover, is extremely
easy to work. Slate must never
be used; there is too much liability of iron
veins being found in it, which in such high
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span>tension experiments as will be described
would seriously impair the usefulness of
the apparatus. The material selected for
the base must be one that will not absorb
moisture. A paraffined surface collects
moisture up to a certain point in isolated
drops, whereas a glass and even a hard
rubber surface condenses the moisture as
a film, which latter is extremely undesirable.
But unfortunately the fact that a
paraffined surface does not present a
pleasing appearance would probably result
in its rejection. And lastly, by
mounting the coil on hard rubber blocks,
or extending the reel ends to raise the coil
body, a high insulation can be obtained at
the sacrifice perhaps of appearance or
height. From the care taken to insulate
the secondary coil, it may be considered a
superfluous precaution to so carefully select
a base, but practical work with the
instrument at some important crisis will
demonstrate the necessity of extreme care
in the smallest details relating to insulation.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span>It may be well to note here that
hard rubber is acted upon by ozone, and
is thereby impaired as an insulator.</p>

<div class="figright" ><a id="fig10"></a>
<img src="images/i_031.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 10.</span></div>
</div>

<p>The base forms the top of a flat box in
which the condenser lies; but there are a
few points worth considering right here.
As the connections of the coil will probably
be under the base,
a sufficient space must
intervene between the
base and the top of the
condenser. It is a good
plan to lay the condenser
at least one half inch below
the top of this box,
and fill up to, say, one
eighth of an inch with
melted paraffin, leaving
the condenser wires projecting for attachment.
The connections of the primary
coil and contact breaker should
by all means be soldered, not simply
wires held under screw nuts. And,
moreover, all wires under the base should
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span>be so run that they do not cross one another,
which precaution only requires a
little planning. Then, when the connections
are all made and the base laid on top
of the box, it can be pressed down if the
paraffin be warm, so that the screw heads
and wires mark out their own channels
and cavities in which to lie.</p>

<p>A commutator or pole-changing switch
is often added to change the polarity of
the battery current. The diagram of connection
is shown in Fig. 10. When the
levers are as in the figure, the circuit is
broken and no current flows through the
coil.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Coils in Series.</span></h3>

<p>Ruhmkorff coils can be connected in
series, but it is not to be recommended.
When it becomes necessary, however, the
cores should be removed, and one long core
inserted, extending through each primary.
This will bring the time constants of each
primary coil together and prevent the interference
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span>otherwise present. The primary
coils and secondary coils are connected in
series by assuming that they are but adjacent
sections of one complete instrument. Of
course, as the resistance of the primary is
raised, the electromotive force of the battery
must be raised also.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Oil Immersed Coil.</span></h3>

<p>A highly satisfactory induction coil can
be made without much labor and few tools,
and will prove useful in many experiments
which would not warrant a more expensive
instrument.</p>

<p>Make a bundle of soft iron wires, No. 22
B W G, for the core, ten inches in length and
one inch or more in diameter. Wrap this
with insulating tape or even ordinary tape
to prevent the primary coil from coming in
contact with the iron. Now, wind on a
primary of two layers No. 14 B &amp; S gauge
cotton-covered copper wire, and insert the
coil into a hard rubber (or glass preferred)
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span>tube large enough to hold the coil tight and
to project an inch or so beyond the core
ends.</p>

<p>A secondary coil of about one pound
No. 36 cotton-covered magnet wire should
now be made on a hard rubber spool, the
hole through centre of this spool must be
at least one inch larger in diameter than the
diameter of the primary cover. This spool
should not exceed four inches in length, and
is to be slipped over the primary coil and
held suspended by blocks of wood in such
a manner that it does not touch the primary
coil or cover. The whole outfit is now
immersed in an earthenware or glass vessel
filled with linseed or heavy paraffin oil.
The contact breaker and condenser will be
mounted independently; the condenser for
the two-inch spark coil will be suitable (see
Table on <a href="#Page_7">page—7</a>).</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">"Tesla" Coil.</span></h3>

<p>The coil just described, without contact
breaker or iron core, can be connected up
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span>and used in place of a "Tesla coil," which
it resembles. The coils used by Nikola
Tesla are so many and varied that it becomes
a difficult task to describe a mode of construction
which will meet the wants of those
who ask for "Tesla" coils. The <i>American
Electrician</i> gives a description of one
wherein a glass battery jar, 6 inches ×
8 inches, is wound with 60 to 80 turns of
No. 18 B &amp; S magnet wire. Into this is
slipped a primary, consisting of 8 to 10
turns of No. 6 B &amp; S wire, and the whole
combination immersed in a vessel containing
linseed or mineral oil.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Disruptive "Tesla" Coil.</span></h3>

<p>For Fig. 11 the specification is as follows:
Secondary, 300 turns of No. 30 B &amp; S silk-covered
magnet wire, wound on rubber tube
or rod, and the ends encased in glass or
rubber tubes. This is inserted <i>into</i> the primary,
which consists of two coils, each of
20 turns No. 16 B &amp; S rubber-covered wire,
wound separately on a long rubber tube not
less than ⅛ inch thick. The last tube must
be large enough to be very loose when the
secondary coil is inserted in it, and it must
project at least two inches over each end of
the secondary. A hard rubber division must
be placed between these primary coils. The
four ends of the latter coils are connected
<i>C C</i> to two condensers and <i>D D</i> to two discharger
balls, the secondary wires going to
the exhibitive apparatus. A further description
of these connections is to be found in
<a href="#CHAPTER_XII">Chapter XII</a>., also notes upon the use of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span>disruptive coil.</p>

<p>
<i>Coils for Gas Engines.</i></p>

<p>These are either primary only or primary
and secondary. Two to three pounds of
No. 14 B &amp; S magnet wire are wound on an
iron wire core eight to ten inches in length
by one inch in diameter. The contact is
made and broken in the igniter of the
engine as at the wipe spring of a ratchet gas
burner. Four to eight large cells of dry
battery are used, or eight cells Edison-Lalande—iron-clad
type. Number of cells
varies with size of coil needed, some classes
of engines require a heavier spark than
others to ignite the vapor.</p>

<p>When a primary and secondary are used,
the primary should be made of two or three
layers No. 14 B &amp; S magnet wire, and a
secondary of one pound No. 34 B &amp; S
magnet wire. There can be an independent
contact breaker or the coil can be made up
similar to a one-half inch spark Ruhmkorff
coil (see Chapter I.).</p>

<div class="figcenter" ><a id="fig12"></a>
<img src="images/i_038.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"> <span class="smcap">Fig. 12.</span></div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span>The method of connecting up a coil of the
latter description is shown in Fig. 12, which
is self-explanatory. It shows a form of
cam-shaft switch which is operated by the
engine, and which opens and closes the primary
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span>circuit of the induction coil, the sparks
from the secondary winding passing between
the points of the igniter in the engine
cylinder. As shown in Fig. 12, the igniter
or ignition plug is similar in operation to a
coil discharger, the two terminals being,
however, insulated from each other by the
use of porcelain. To ensure a good insulation
under the severe working conditions
has been somewhat of a task, but it seems to
have been attained in the types of igniters
known as the Splitdorf and the Roche or
New Standard.</p>

<p>The Splitdorf gas-engine coil is the result
of much experiment and careful design. It
is built to stand hard usage, and the insulation
used has been adopted only after exhaustive
test. In automobile work, where a
heavy strain is made upon the engine, as in
climbing heavy grades, it has been found
that a stronger spark gives surer results.
This would indicate more battery current
through the coil, and it is a wise precaution
to have a few extra cells attached that can be
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span>switched on if necessary.</p>

<p>In constructing spark coils for gas engines
particular care must be given to the contact
breaker. In most types of gas or oil vapor
engines it is absolutely necessary to have
the spark pass with uniform regularity, and
immediately and surely when required. For
automobiles or where the apparatus is subject
to jar, a heavy iron vibrating armature
would become unreliable by reason of its
inertia and its responding to shock. At
every jolt of the vehicle it would jar and
get out of rhythm, and it certainly seems
preferable to use a mechanical contact apparatus
whenever feasible. In the older type
of gas engine the spark is made by mechanism
breaking contact right in the vapor.
The actual arrangement of these devices is
detailed and illustrated in the later works
on gas and oil engines.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Resistance Coils.</span></h3>

<p>Although foreign to the title of this book,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span>these coils will be mentioned, being often
necessary as accessories to the operation of
coils, wireless telegraphy, etc. These are
coils of insulated German silver wire, wound
to a specified resistance. The main feature
about those designed for testing is that they
are wound non-inductively—that is, the
wire is wound double in such manner that
the current flows both ways around the
turns, and so neutralizes the inductive action.
In cases where dynamo current is to be
used, as in telegraphs operated from dynamo
current, the coils are wound on tin tubes to
make them fireproof and yet radiate the
heat. As the resistance of German silver
varies very largely, only approximate figures
can be given. The table (<a href="#Page_64">page 64</a>) has
been made up from the best averages obtainable.
The carrying capacity of resistance
coils varies with their construction, the
better they can radiate heat, the more current
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span>they can safely carry.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">General Remarks on Coils, etc.</span></h3>

<p>Ruhmkorff induction coils should always
be fitted with a switch to open, close, or
reverse the power circuit, a double throw,
double pole, baby knife switch, mounted on
a separate porcelain base, is very suitable.
Such a switch is open when the handle is
vertical, and it should always be left so when
changing connections, fixing battery, etc.
A large, well-finished coil will have the
secondary wires brought in rubber tubes to
binding posts mounted on hard rubber pillars,
or to binding posts mounted considerably
above the coil cover level. A very neat
mode is shown in the frontispiece on the
large 45-inch spark coil. Here the secondary
wires go to hard rubber pillars, which also
carry adjustable rod dischargers. These
rods are movable towards or away from
each other by means of the large hard rubber
handle to which they are connected by a
simple system of levers. In this coil the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span>secondary is moulded on a flexible tube,
which fits loosely over the primary tube in
order to compensate for changes of temperature
and consequent expansions and contractions.
All well-designed coils should be
so arranged that the primary coil and core
can be readily removed from the secondary,
or <i>vice versa</i>. It is sometimes desirable to
use a different primary. This arrangement
will greatly facilitate any necessary repairs.
It must be always remembered that the
working of a coil depends on the insulation
between primary and secondary. <i>Spare no
pains to have perfect insulation</i>; it is a
hopeless task to reinsulate a broken-down
secondary, although the sectional method
of winding facilitates repairs. In large
winding rooms it is customary to have a
revolution counter connected to the spindle,
so that the number of turns can be seen at
all times. A bicycle cyclometer can be
readily fitted up for this purpose, and will
be found of considerable assistance where
a number of sections are needed, each with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span>a similar number of turns. In the commercial
construction of telephone coils and
magnet spools it is often the rule to specify
only the number of turns of the requisite
size wire, the ampere turns of the coils being
thus regulated.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Testing of a Coil for Polarity.</span></h3>

<p>This is often necessary, and may be done
in a variety of ways. When the coil is working,
and sparks be passed between fine wires
mounted on the discharger, the positive wire
tip will be cold, whereas the negative end
will be quite hot. In vacuo, the positive
shows a purple red when the negative glows
with a bluish violet. The decomposition of
water, which consists of oxygen and hydrogen
in the formula H<sub>2</sub>O, is readily accomplished
by the secondary current, and the
greatest volume of gas (hydrogen) will be
evolved at the <i>negative pole</i>. For ready
reference a summary of these facts is given

<p>Although it is customary to use bundles
of fine, soft iron wire for coil cores, very
excellent results have been obtained with
cores made up of soft iron filings. These
filings should be tightly packed in the core
tube and have a soft iron head at the contact
breaker end. Filings demagnetize very
quickly and prevent the formation of destructive
eddy currents, which have been
previously discussed (Chapter I.).</p>

<p>Modern practice tends towards a lengthening
of the core and primary, in some cases
fully 20 per cent of the core length projects
from each end of the coil. One result must
be as in electromagnets, the longer the core,
the longer it takes to magnetize or demag<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span>netize.
But even here it is a matter of
individual construction.</p>

<p>The common practice is to make coils to
be in a horizontal position; there is no reason
why they cannot be made to stand on end.
In fact, this position to an extent takes off
some of the strain on the primary. It is
mostly a matter of choice or convenience.</p>

<p>As to the possible output of an induction
coil, it depends upon design and construction;
but S. P. Thompson gives the following
law in his work on Electricity and
Magnetism: The electromotive force generated
in the secondary circuit is to that
employed in the primary nearly in the same
proportion as the relative turns of the two
coils.<a id="FNanchor_1_1" href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">1</a></p>

<div class="footnotes">
<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_1_1" href="#FNanchor_1_1" class="label">1</a>
We do not attempt to reconcile this quotation with the enormous
estimates of spark potential.</p></div></div>

<p>In selecting a Ruhmkorff coil, it must be
remembered that the rating in spark length
is subject to question. Supposing two similar
coils be operated, one with a rapid vibrator
and the other with a slow vibrator,
other things being equal, the slow vibrator
will give the greatest spark length. Again,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span>
the appearance of the spark is of vast importance.
Although two coils might be
sparking across the same length air-gap, the
one giving the whitest and thickest continuous
succession of sparks is the better. Fig.
13 shows a reproduction from a photograph
of a spark 32 inches long, generated by the
coil shown on the frontispiece.</p>

<div class="figcenter" ><a id="fig13"></a>
<img src="images/i_047.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 13.</span></div>
</div>

<p>It is easy to take a coil, and by snapping
the vibrator contacts together a few times a
spark of thin bluish character will jump<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span>
across a gap, of length far exceeding the
spark gap when vibrator is working at normal
speed. But this spark only passes at
irregular intervals, seemingly gathering
strength for its forced leap. It must not be
considered in rating the coil.</p>

<p>In winding primary coils it is proposed
to reduce the self-induction or inductance
of its adjacent coils by means of similar
methods used in winding electromagnets.
The primary winding, instead of being composed
of a number of turns of one large
wire, is made up of a multiple winding of
small wires, aggregating the conductivity
of the large wire. This materially reduces
sparking at the contact breaker, and certainly
allows of a closer bedding of wire
nearer the core, also giving a greater percentage
of ampere turns. Another scheme
which uses the Dessauer contact breaker
provides two separate primary windings,
opening one when the other closes. Such
schemes as these come well within the scope
of the experimenter, and it is highly possible<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49</span>
that valuable improvements will be made in
coil design during the coming years.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Failure to Work.</span></h3>

<p>The following are the commonest causes
of coils not working to their best limit:
Contact breaker contacts dirty, burned,
stuck, too small, not in good parallel relation
face to face of platinum.</p>

<p>Secondary wires crossed outside coil,
often happens that the secondary is quietly
sparking away into or through some object
touching it, particularly when long wire
connections are run from secondary to place
of desired sparking.</p>

<p>Condenser too small, burned out, badly
insulated (see other pages on this subject).</p>

<p>Battery too small—too high internal
resistance or wires leading from battery to
coil too small—for ordinary coil work, distance
of, perhaps, ten feet, use No. 10 to 12
B &amp; S flexible lamp cord or solid wire.
Ruhmkorff coils require plenty of current
to produce large sparks.</p>

<p>As it is not always convenient to procure
paper and foil in set sizes, the area of
material needed for condensers is also given.
The above table is approximate. It represents
data collected from the best modern
practice. The gauge above given for copper
wire is that of Brown &amp; Sharpe, and is
used throughout these pages.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Medical Coils.</span></h3>

<p>The main points of difference between
coils for electrotherapeutics and Ruhmkorff
coils is that the former are devoid of condensers,
are rarely insulated to a high degree,
and are arranged for current strength regulation.
The modes of regulation are many,
briefly the principal are: (<i>a</i>) In coils with
independent circuit breakers, sliding both
core and primary coil out of the secondary
together or independently. (<i>b</i>) Moving a
metal tube over or off the primary coil or
core or both. Many combinations of these
methods are practised. Attempts have been
made to regulate battery current by rheostat,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span>
but it is not feasible, except in large stationary
outfits. Cheap medical coils are wound
with bare wire, with layers of thread between
adjacent turns, or even only bedding
the wire turns in paraffined paper. It is not
intended to convey the idea that winding
bare wire coils is a makeshift; far from it.
This method is being very generally adopted
in telephone work. But it requires special
and delicate machinery, and is unsuited to
amateur work, where slight differences of
cost or labor are insignificant. Others for
specific purposes consist of a primary coil
only. The best and most complete made
are so arranged that independent secondary
coils of different sized wires can be used
with the one primary, being readily slipped
on or off as required. There is another
scheme of regulation, where the coil is
wound in sections and these sections cut in
or out by means of a switch, but it is not
desirable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Medical Coil with Tube Regulation.</span></h3>

<div class="figcenter" ><a id="fig14"></a>
<img src="images/i_053.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 14.</span></div>
</div>

<p>Figure 14 shows a coil with tube mode of
regulation. The core <i>C</i> consists of a piece of
iron tube, very thin, 4 inches long by ⅜ inch
diameter, and filled with soft iron wires.
One end of this core is firmly fixed in the
left-hand bobbin head. The object of the
iron tube is to prevent the sliding tube from
catching in the iron wires, otherwise it can
be dispensed with. Over this tube is slipped
a brass tube <i>T</i>, ending in a handle <i>H</i> at the
right-hand end; this must work easily over
the core tube. The spool for the primary is
now made up by fixing the other bobbin head
on a paper or fibre tube and fastening its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">54</span>
free end to the left-hand bobbin head, or the
spool can be made in the usual way by
glueing up two spool ends on a fibre or paper
tube and securing the iron core firmly in one
end, allowing room, of course, for the brass
tube to slide in at the right-hand end. The
primary winding is three or four layers of
No. 20 B &amp; S gauge cotton-covered magnet
wire, the ends being brought out for future
connection. Over this is now laid a few
layers of paraffined paper, and ten or twelve
layers of No. 36 B &amp; S cotton-covered
magnet wire is wound on for the secondary
coil.</p>

<p>The contact breaker <i>R</i> is in no way different
from the simple form described in
Chapter II. Its construction can be readily
seen from the figure.</p>

<p>A layer of cloth of the kind used in
covering electromagnets is laid on over the
secondary, and the coil is ready to be attached
to the base. The base is seven inches
long by three wide, and has little feet at its
four corners to elevate it from the table and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55</span>
prevent abrasion of the connections underneath.</p>

<div class="figcenter" ><a id="fig15"></a>
<img src="images/i_055.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 15.</span></div>
</div>

<p>The connections are as given in Fig. 15.
When in operation, the electrode cords
being attached to binding posts, Nos. 1 and
2 are in circuit with the secondary coil only.
When at Nos. 2 and 3 they receive the
induced current or extra current in the
primary, caused by the break of the battery
circuit (see page 3).</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Medical Coil with Interchangeable
Secondaries.</span></p>

<p>This form of coil is the only one for
practical medical work, and more space will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">56</span>
be given to its construction than to the foregoing,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">57</span>
which is suited only for limited use.</p>

<div class="figcenter" ><a id="fig16"></a>
<img src="images/i_056.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 16.</span></div>
</div>

<p>Fig. 16 shows side elevation of coil on
base. The design can be largely varied, also
it can be used either for a wall board, a
cabinet top, or made to be carried in a case
containing battery, electrodes, etc. <i>S</i> is one
of the secondary coils, of which at least three
should be provided. The dimensions are, of
course, the same—namely, four inches long
by 3½ inches wide over all. The spool ends
are furnished with heel pieces, which slide
under the brass track bar <i>T</i>. This accurately
centres the coil and prevents it from working
loose.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Windings for Secondary.</span></h3>

<p>The following windings for removable or
interchangeable secondary coils are those
most in use.</p>

<p>Coil No. 1. 4500 feet (.375 pound)
No. 36 B &amp; S, approximating 1800 ohms.
This may be led out in three divisions by
means of switch on coil head. First divi<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span>sion,
4500 feet; second division, 3000 feet;
third division, 1500 feet.</p>

<p>Coil No. 2. 2400 feet (.6 pound) No. 31
B &amp; S, about 350 ohms, divided into 2400
feet, 1500 feet, and 900 feet.</p>

<p>Coil No. 3. 750 feet (1 pound) No. 22
B &amp; S in one coil, or two divisions of 500
and 750 feet, respectively; approximate resistance
of wire, 125 ohms.</p>

<p>Coil No. 4. It may be necessary to obtain
currents of extremely high tension, in which
case a coil may be prepared of 5000 feet
No. 38 B &amp; S, or No. 40 B &amp; S preferably.</p>

<p>The finer the wire, the less current and
the most sedative effect; the coarser the
wire, the more current with corresponding
increased painful action.</p>

<p>The spools, in fact as much of the framework
as possible, should be made of hard
rubber, to which a fine finish can be given,
although mahogany, rosewood, or even
stained oak can be used. On each side of
the right-hand spool heads a flat brass spring
is screwed, making the contact for the sec<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">59</span>ondary
wires on brass strips screwed on top
of the track rods. These secondary connections
can be made by means of flexible cords
to binding posts, but the sliding contact is
preferable. The primary coil <i>P</i> is firmly
held in the left spool head, and consists of
a core of No. 22 B W G soft iron wires,
insulated and wound with three layers of
No. 20 B &amp; S magnet wire. The outside of
this coil is neatly enclosed in a hard rubber
tube to permit of the secondary coils sliding
freely upon it. It is better, however, for
the secondary coils not to touch the primary
tube. The vibrator, or contact breaker,
should be of the adjustable form shown in
Fig. 17. The adjusting screw for the contact
breaker can be mounted in a brass lug
carried by the spool head.</p>

<p>Connections of this coil are substantially
the same as those of the first-described
medical coil. This apparatus is well worthy
of elaboration; it should be fitted with a
ribbon vibrator as well as an adjustable
speed slow vibrator, a switch controlling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span>
either. A great variety of secondary coils
can be made, those of coarse wire taking
the place of the current from the contact
breaker. The vibrators should be operated
from an independent battery, although in
the last coil described the magnet may be
wound with the same size wire as the primary
and then be in series with it. The
secondary spools can be made of stained
hard wood ends fitted on to fibre tube, which
latter is easily procurable. Particular attention
should always be paid to the spools and
heads; if not properly made, they may come
apart, and a disastrous unravelling of the
wires ensues.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Bath Coils.</span></h3>

<p>A coil much used for electric baths has
a primary winding only, regulated by the
sliding in and out of the iron core, which
necessitates the use of an independent
vibrator, or else by varying the current
strength with a rheostat. The general
directions given before will answer in the
present case, the only data necessary being
the size of wire, which should be about six
to ten layers of No. 20 B &amp; S. The coil
with movable secondaries here comes into
service. Strong currents are needed for
bath work, and any variety of winding can
be used with this make of coil. There are so
many descriptions of bath and small medical
coils in the electrical magazines published
for amateur workers, that it is hardly necessary
here to give more than a mention of
the principal ones.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Hints in Caring for Medical Coils.</span></h3>

<p>A few remarks on medical coils and their
diseases may not be amiss; often a very little
defect, if remedied in time, will prevent
costly repairs.</p>

<p>The main care in medical electrical apparatus
is the battery (see Chapter X. for
descriptions of coil batteries and their operation).
Clean, fresh solutions and clean
contacts are essential. Keep zincs well
amalgamated, remove wires from binding
posts, and scrape bright the metal where the
wires make connection; see no fluid is
splashed on contacts, clean all contact
springs periodically. The Edison-Lalande
battery is probably the best for medical use,
but even this requires occasional attention
as to contacts, new zincs, fresh solution, etc.</p>

<p>Poor adjustment at contact breaker, dirty
or corroded contacts, loose wires, loose
binding posts, corroded binding posts, are
often the only trouble in a coil refusing to
work.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">63</span></p>

<p>Flexible cords are fruitful of trouble:
the tinsel breaks, and there is no circuit; gets
wet and crosses or causes a leak; cord tips
get loose and alternately open and close a
contact; one minute all is well, next minute
no current can be obtained. Another trouble
in acid batteries is caused by leaving the
zincs in the fluid. It is easy to do it in most
cases, although the ingenuity of the leading
medical electrical apparatus makers to-day
is directed to this point. Cleanliness and
careful inspection of all contacts is well
repaid; carelessness surely brings its evils.</p>

<p>It is very desirable in medical work to
eliminate the noise attendant upon the working
of the coil vibrator. This jarring or
humming is often in itself a source of irritation
to a nervous patient. The sound can be
deadened in various ways, for instance, by
placing over the vibrator a temporary wood
cover, lined with felt, resting upon a soft
rubber gasket; or in any other manner that
may suggest itself to the operator.</p>

<small>CONTACT BREAKERS.</small></h2>
</div>
<div class="figright" ><a id="fig18"></a>
<img src="images/i_065.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 18.</span></div>
</div>

<p>The simple form of contact breaker already
described is useful up to a certain
point, but it has
disadvantages.
Its rate of vibration
is only variable
through narrow
limits, and it
is not suitable for
very heavy currents.
But as it
stands it has done
long service, and
will be used probably
wherever
the requirements from it are not exacting.
The most desirable form of this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">66</span>
simple spring break is shown in Fig.
18. <i>R</i> is the soft iron armature; <i>S</i>, the
spring; <i>C</i>, check-nut which holds the adjusting
screw <i>A</i> from becoming loose; <i>T</i>, a
second adjusting screw used to tighten
the spring and so raise its rate of vibration;
<i>K</i> is the base to which one wire of
the coil is attached; <i>L</i>, base of adjusting
device to which battery wire runs at <i>I</i>.
Where tightening screw T passes through
the pillar of the adjusting screw, the hole
therein is bushed with rubber to prevent
accidental contact. Both <i>A</i> and <i>T</i> are provided
with insulating heads of rubber or
ivory. At <i>B</i> are the platinum contacts,
which should be fully ⅛ inch in diameter.</p>

<p>One serious defect in the action of the
simple spring vibrator (Fig. 19) is the
tendency of the spring to vibrate, as it
were, sinusoidally. This causes an irregularity
in the rate of the vibrations, which
affects the discharge of the coil very considerably.
By far the better plan is to use
a very short thick spring riveted to an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">67</span>
arm carrying the armature at its end (Fig.
20). <i>R</i> is the armature, <i>S</i> the piece of
spring, and <i>K</i> the point of attachment to
the base. The actual width of the portion
of the spring which vibrates—the hinge
portion, it might be called—should not be
over ⅛ inch.</p>

<div class="figcenter" ><a id="fig19"></a>
<img src="images/i_067.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 19.</span> <span class="smcap">Fig. 20.</span></div>
</div>

<p>The rate of motion is high; but an
erroneous notion has been taken of its
performance by many persons in the
knowledge of the writer. The rate of
vibration is <i>not</i> wholly dependent on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span>
size, or, rather, smallness of its spring;
the arm and armature considerably alter
this, although they are not pliable, by reason
of their mass and the momentum consequent
on their mass.</p>

<p>A word here on the size of the armature.
It should be somewhat larger than
the face of the electro-magnet core, and
should be thick—that is, in a circular
form—say one half its diameter. Of
course this does not apply to the steel
lever armature before mentioned. It is
impossible to lay down arbitrary rules
where the conditions are not determined,
but a very small amount of experimenting
will demonstrate the correct lines on
which to build.</p>

<p>When in action, all rapid rheotomes
give out a definite musical note whereby
the rate of vibration can be determined.
Reference to any work on acoustics will
show a table of the number of vibrations
necessary to produce any stated musical
note. The foregoing style of rheotome<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">69</span>
forms the basis of very nearly all those
which are in use. The shorter and stouter
a spring the more rapidly will it vibrate,
and <i>vice-versa</i>. Carrying out this rule,
we can manufacture an instrument which
will give as high as 2500 vibrations per
second (Fig. 21).</p>

<div class="figcenter" ><a id="fig21"></a>
<img src="images/i_069.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 21.</span></div>
</div>

<p>The armature <i>A</i> is a piece of flat hard
steel bar ¼ × ½ inch, held rigidly on the
metal support <i>S</i> and just clearing the up<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">70</span>per
surfaces of the magnet cores <i>C</i>. The
adjusting screw <i>P</i> should be provided with
an arm, <i>B B</i>, whereby the rotation of it can
be delicately varied. This screw must
also be firmly held or the high speed of
the armature will jar it loose. A check-nut
on each side of the frame carrying it
should be provided in every case. The
necessary platinum contact can be hammered
into a hole drilled before the armature
is hardened. The proper place for
this contact is about one fourth of the total
length of the armature from its support,
although in the simple contact breaker it can
be placed at the distance of one third if desired.
The reason is that the concussion
of the adjusting screw dampens the free
vibration, and the amplitude thereof is lessened
in addition to the counter vibrations
of the screw disturbing the regular vibrationary
series.</p>

<p>Owing to the fact that the amplitude of
the armature vibration is so small, a very
delicate adjustment is necessary. The ad<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">71</span>justing
screw can be placed nearer the
free end, but for the reasons given it is not
to be desired. The metal bridge should
be a solid casting, and the armature
clamped by more than one screw.</p>

<p>The mercury vibrator, which is applied
to almost every large coil, is as follows:</p>

<p>A pivoted arm carries on one end a
soft iron armature, which is attracted by
the coil core. The other end is provided
with a platinum point adjustable by a set
screw. This platinum point dips into a
mercury cup—a glass cup containing mercury,
with a thin layer of spirits of turpentine.
The object of the spirits of turpentine,
which is a non-conductor, is to help
choke off the spark which would ensue
whenever the platinum point was raised
from the mercury.</p>

<p>A form of contact breaker which will
admit of great variation of speed, and
which is adapted to carry large currents,
is the wheel-break, constructed in the following
manner:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">72</span></p>

<p>A brass or copper disk 3 inches or more
in diameter and upward of ½ inch thick
has its periphery divided by a number of
saw cuts, which divisions are often filled
in with plugs of hard rubber or fibre.
This disk is mounted on a shaft, which latter
is either the shaft of an electro-motor,
or is provided with a pulley by which it
can be rapidly rotated. A strip of spring
copper on each side of the disk presses
upon the toothed surface, one strip being
connected to the coil and the other to the
battery or other current source. It will
now be seen that when the disk rotates the
slits or pieces of hard rubber cause the
break in the circuit through the brushes or
copper strips, the rapidity of the breaks
depending upon the rate of rotation of the
disk, and the number of slits in the wheel.</p>

<p>The slits or rubber pieces should be one-half
the width of the intervening brass,
but must be at least one sixteenth of an
inch in width, especially where a high
voltage is used in the primary coil.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">73</span></p>

<p>The shaft of the machine may serve as
one point of connection in place of one of
the copper brushes; but in this event
either a wide journal must be used, or else
some conducting substance, as plumbago,
replace the lubricating oil in the bearings.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Pole Changing Breaker.</span></h3>

<p>Fig. 22 shows a diagram of a pole
changing contact breaker which will allow
of rapid alternations of current. It is operated
by an electric motor by preference,
although any motive power can be applied
to it.</p>

<div class="figcenter" ><a id="fig22"></a>
<img src="images/i_074.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 22.</span></div>
</div>

<p><i>W a W b</i> are two brass wheels, the peripheries
of which are broken by the insertion
of insulating blocks <i>I I</i>, shown black
in the sketch. <i>S S</i> are the shafts on which
the wheels are mounted, the two wheels
being necessarily insulated from each
other. 1, 2, 3, 4 are four brushes of copper
pressing on the rim of the wheel and
leading in the current from the battery <i>B</i>.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">74</span>
The primary coil is attached to the brass<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">75</span>
body of the wheel or to the shafts. When
the wheel is in the position shown, the coil
and battery are on an open circuit; but on
the wheel commencing to revolve, the
brushes 1 and 2 bear on the brass, and the
current flows from the positive pole of the
battery to 2 through the wheel <i>W a</i> to the
coil <i>P</i>, up through wheel <i>W b</i> and out at
1 back to the battery. The next position
of the brushes 1 and 2 will be on the insulations,
and 3 and 4 will come into action.
Then the positive current will reach <i>W b</i>
by means of brush 3, and after traversing
the primary coil and wheel <i>W a</i>, emerge at
4 to the battery, thus reversing the current
through <i>P</i> as many times as there are sets
of segments, which latter can be multiplied
according to requirements. The
main point to be considered after that of
good connections is that the brushes 1 and
3 and 2 and 4 do not at any time touch
any part of the brass wheel at the same
time, as this would short circuit the bat<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">76</span>tery.
This is avoided by making the insulating
space longer than the brass surface,
and adjusting the brushes as in the sketch,
that each pair of them is a fraction further
apart than the length of the brass tooth.</p>

<p>Accordingly, a wheel may be constructed
with many segments and rotated at a
high speed and rapid reversals of current
produced, the uses of which are manifold.</p>

<p>As will be described in the notes on the
Tesla effects, an electro-magnet, the poles
of which are brought near the sparking
point of the contact breaker, will help wipe
out the spark, and so assist the suddenness
of the break.</p>

<p>An extremely successful expedient in
operating contact breakers is to employ a
high-pressure air blast directed point blank
against the contact point. The effect of
this air blast when the contact is made is
of course null, but on the platinum surfaces
becoming separated, the high air
pressure produced forms a path of extremely
high resistance, and tends to blow<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">77</span>
off the spark as soon as it is generated.
The stream of air should issue from an insulated
nozzle of glass or rubber, and should
not contain moisture.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Wehnelt Interrupter.</span></h3>

<p>One of the most important inventions in
coil work is the electrolytic interrupter of
Wehnelt. Briefly, the apparatus consists of
a vessel containing a solution of acid, into
which dip two electrodes connected in series
with the source of power and the primary of
the coil. Upon passing a current through
the combination the fluid becomes agitated
at the electrodes and a rapid make and break
of the current ensues (Fig. 23).</p>

<div class="figcenter" ><a id="fig23"></a>
<img src="images/i_078.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 23.</span></div>
</div>

<p>It requires considerable electromotive
force for operation, a minimum of 40 volts
being desirable. Its rapidity of action varies
up to and at times exceeding 4000 interruptions
per second. A Wehnelt interrupter
can be made as follows: Procure a glass jar
<i>J</i> holding about one quart or a little less, also<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">78</span>
a cover for same <i>C</i>, a piece of sheet lead <i>L</i>
large enough to fit loosely across the jar and
yet not touch the bottom, eight inches of
one-quarter-inch glass tube <i>M</i>, a few inches
of No. 20 platinum wire <i>P</i>, and two ounces
of mercury. Heat the end of the glass tube
in a gas flame, and bend an inch or less at
a right angle; at the same time seal in the
platinum wire by means of a blowpipe, so
that the tip just projects from the bent end<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">79</span>
of the tube. This sealing can be accomplished
readily by one unused to working
glass, but almost any philosophical instrument
maker will have it done at small cost.
Holes being bored through the cover, the
lead plate and the glass tube are fitted in, the
platinum point almost touching the lead.
Adjustment is, however, easy, as the tube,
being turned, will retract or advance the
platinum point from or towards the lead
electrode. Nearly fill the jar with a solution
composed of one part sulphuric acid to
eight parts water, and fill up the glass tube
with mercury. The connections can then
be made by means of a clamp on the lead
and a wire dipping into the mercury. Connect
the lead plate <i>L</i> to one pole of the
battery or source of energy, and the platinum-mercury
electrode <i>F</i> to one post of
primary. The other side of battery and coil
being closed, the apparatus will begin to
work. No condenser is needed with this
interrupter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">80</span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Dessauer Contact Breaker.</span></h3>

<p>This is a modification of the spring
hammer-head type, but has a platinum contact
on both sides of the spring. It thus
obtains double vibrations, but is liable to
stick. The elasticity of the spring normally
prevents the circuit remaining closed on the
forward movement of the hammer head, but
this combination requires attention.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Steel Ribbon Interrupter.</span></h3>

<p>For light currents and rapid vibrations,
such as are employed in electrotherapy, the
steel ribbon interrupter is suitable. It consists
of a steel ribbon <i>V</i> one-half inch wide
by six or eight inches long and the thickness
of a stout visiting-card. Near the end is
riveted a platinum contact. One end of the
ribbon is held by a brass upright <i>R</i>, to which
connection is made to circuit; the other end
is riveted to a threaded rod, which passes
through a brass pillar, and is held by a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">81</span>
thumb-screw and check nut <i>S</i>. Turning the
thumb-screw either way tightens or loosens
the ribbon and so raises or lowers the rate
of vibration (Fig. 24).</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Contact Breakers in Vacuo.</span></h3>

<p>Contact breakers in vacuo, as applied to
Ruhmkorff coils, are by no means of recent
date. Poggendorff made use of such prior
to 1859, and noted the diminished sparking
at the contact breaker and increased effect
in the secondary circuit.</p>

</div>

<p>Mr. D. McFarlan Moore, whose experi<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">82</span>ments
in vacuum tube lighting have proven
so interesting, was granted patents upon
various forms of contact breakers, in which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">83</span>
the chief merit was that the contacts were
broken in a vacuum. The sparking was
almost eliminated, and the suddenness of
the break of contact so accentuated as to
materially improve the output of an induction
coil. A perusal of his patents, copies
of which may be procured through almost
any bookseller, will prove profitable to the
coil constructor.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Queen Contact Breaker.</span></h3>

<p>The most important advantage of this
arrangement is the abrupt break, owing to
a collar in the vibrator striking a movable
contact while at full speed. Reference to
Fig. 25 will show that the movable platinum
contact is carried on a small vertical spring
behind the vibrator spring, and projects
through a collar on the vibrator spring.
When the contact is made, the movement of
the vibrator is not arrested, but continues at
its full amplitude, thus allowing a long
"make." The vibrator is kept moving at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">84</span>
a constant amplitude by means of the small
coil shown in the illustration, which is in
shunt with the main circuit. In the old
forms there has always been a liability of
the platinum contacts sticking (or welding
together). In the new form, as the break is
made when the vibrator is in the middle of
its swing, the sudden blow with the entire
momentum of the iron hammer head is
always sufficient to break the platinums
apart. This form of contact breaker is very
efficient on electric-light circuits, and operates
with the utmost regularity.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Queen Contact Breaker for Large
Coils.</span></h3>

<p>This is a device where the actual break
is made in alcohol between large studs of
platinum nearly one-quarter inch in diameter.
The bottom contact can be raised or
lowered by means of an adjusting screw.
The top contact is secured into the bottom
end of a rod passing down a guide tube into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">85</span>
the alcohol to meet the lower contact. By
means of an electric motor and a cam
motion, the top contact and plunger are made
to work up and down in the alcohol, thus
making and breaking the current flow. One
of the commendable features of this contact
breaker is that the platinum studs are caused
to revolve while in operation, thus presenting
new faces to each other after each blow.
The apparatus is not adapted for rapid
action, but for the handling of heavy currents.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Adjustable Contact Breaker for
Medical Coils.</span></p>

<p>An adjustable contact breaker for medical
coils is shown in Fig. 26. <i>M M</i> are the
magnet coils, <i>A</i> is the armature, carrying
a platinum contact, which vibrates against
the adjusting screw <i>P</i>. The armature is
pivoted at <i>J</i>, but is held at a distance from
the magnets by the springs <i>S S</i>. The other
end of the armature carries a ball <i>B</i>, which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">86</span>
can be slid up and down on the rod and set
at any point by a set-screw. When the ball
is at the end of the armature rod most
remote from the magnets, the vibrations are
slowest; when moved towards the magnets,
the vibrations become more rapid. Adjustment
of the two springs <i>S S</i> at <i>R R</i> enables
the contact breaker to operate on varying
current strength, and also tends to lessen
the jerkiness of gravity contact breakers.
A flat spring, however, can be substituted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">87</span>
for the spiral springs, in which case the pivot
would be dispensed with and the spring
riveted, as in the hammer form of vibrator.
The illustration shows this arranged for
a wall board, but it can readily be adapted
for table work.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Adjustable Cone Vibrator.</span></h3>

<p>Fig. 27 shows a form of contact breaker
much used in portable medical coils for slow
speeds. It consists of a cone of iron <i>H</i>,
mounted on the vibrator spring, and furnished
with adjustable contact spring and
screw <i>A</i>. Its amplitude of vibration is
limited by the two pins mounted on the
disc, between which the cone vibrates. The
disc is turned by hand, thus moving the
pins, and so varying the travel of the cone <i>H</i>
to and from the core <i>C</i>. It does not give
good results from the fact that the rhythmical
movements are disturbed every time
the cone strikes against the pins, also at the
contact spring striking the contact screw.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">88</span>
As we showed before, a really satisfactory
contact breaker should have a spring, which
allows of no sinusoidal movement. Where
a pivoted armature is governed by a spiral
spring, the result is a series of steady,
rhythmical shocks, provided the adjustments
are satisfactory.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Coil Head Contact Breaker.</span></h3>

<p>Fig. 28 shows the details of a contact
breaker to be attached to the coil head direct.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">89</span>
It is often used on very small coils, which,
together with a miniature dry cell, is slipped
into a pocket case. An important detail in
small coils is to use a contact breaker of sufficient
size. Most of them are not large
enough to stand ordinary usage, the adjusting
screw is not of sufficient diameter and
the thread soon strips. There is no reason
why the adjusting screw, its platinum tip,
and the pillar or lug which holds it should
not be solidly built, it would certainly require
less adjustment. Either single or
double check-nuts can be fitted to the adjust<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">90</span>ment
screws of nearly all the forms of contact
breakers described.</p>

<div class="figcenter" ><a id="fig28"></a>

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 28.</span></div>
</div>

<h3><span class="smcap">Contacts.</span></h3>

<p>It is absolutely essential that the <i>diameter</i>
of contacts for all contact breakers should
be as large as possible and their faces filed
truly parallel to enable them to easily carry
all the current required. One of the main
causes of failure of coil is burning of the
platinum point and platinum burr, the current
being then materially reduced. Large
sparks at point of rupture are often indications
that the condenser is not working
properly—perhaps has broken down or is
not large enough. The contacts will sometimes
fuse together; at any rate, the excessive
sparking is an evidence of waste as
much as in a dynamo generator.</p>

<p>The adjustable method of arranging condensers
(see Chapter IV.) is here of great
value, but it is easy to attach more condenser<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">91</span>
sections to the contact screw pillar and
vibrator pillar and notice result. In the construction
of Ruhmkorff coils it is a good plan
to make all connections possible on the coil
base, instead of inside the condenser chamber.
This is done either by means of rubber-covered
wires or neat strips of brass, screwed
down on the base from points of connection,
and, of course, carefully bent over or well
insulated from all other leads which they
have to cross.</p>

<p>The best makers of induction coils construct
their instruments so that they can be
readily taken apart with as little detachment
of connections as possible.</p>

<small>INSULATIONS AND CEMENTS.</small></h2>
</div>

<p>In selecting an insulating compound for
apparatus designed to be under the influence
of high tension currents, a glance at
some of the peculiarities of such currents
will not be out of place. Mineral oil is
used in many of the converters employed
to transform the high voltage currents on
the mains of the alternating electric-light
systems to the comparatively low voltage
used at the points of consumption. Professor
Elihu Thomson, in a series of experiments,
noticed some interesting facts
in the sparking distances of high potentials
in oils.</p>

<p>He found that discharges of low frequencies,
as 125 alternations per second,
were capable of puncturing mineral oils at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">93</span>
one third to one half the thickness of an
air layer sufficient to just resist punctures
by the same discharge; but with frequencies
of 50,000 to 100,000 per second, an oil
thickness of one thirtieth to one sixtieth
was a sufficient barrier.</p>

<p>At a frequency of 125 per second, a half-inch
spark in the air penetrated one third
to one fourth inch of oil; but at frequencies
of 50,000 to 100,000 per second, a
layer of oil one fourth of an inch successfully
resisted the passage of a spark which
freely passed through 8 inches of air.</p>

<p>The effect of drying an oil improved its
insulating qualities. (Tesla uses boiled-out
linseed-oil.)</p>

<p>He also noted that pointed electrodes
could be brought nearer together under
oil than balls without allowing a discharge.
Flat plates allowed of still greater sparking
distances. Tesla notes that oil through
which sparks have passed must be discarded,
probably owing to particles of carbon
being formed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">94</span></p>

<p>Paraffin wax has a higher resistance than
oil, providing it has not been heated over
135° C. It will stand alternate heating up
to 100° C. and cooling, being of lower resistance
when hot than when cold. But
a serious permanent deterioration takes
place when it has been heated over 100°C.;
its color, from the normal pure white,
changes to a yellowish tint when its insulation
is impaired. Paraffin also undergoes
a deterioration when heated for a
long time even at 100° C., and should
never be used for fine work when it is at
all yellow. It is always best to melt it in
a hot-water bath, not permitting, however,
any steam or moisture to come near
it. In this climate (United States) it is
not so necessary to mix in any tallow to
obviate brittleness, the average temperature
of most workshops being sufficiently
high to keep it from becoming brittle.</p>

<p>Resin oils do not suffer permanent injury
from being heated, as does paraffin,
but their insulating properties diminish<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">95</span>
much more rapidly on becoming even
warm, the initial resistance of resin oils
being lower than that of paraffin.</p>

<p>Paraffin has a fault—its tendency to absorb
a slight degree of moisture. It has
been found in telephone and telegraph
cables saturated with paraffin that this is a
very important cause of their deterioration.
In Ruhmkorff coils, however, which
are intended for operation in enclosed
places free from damp atmospheres, the
absorption of moisture would be probably
reduced to its minimum.</p>

<p>There is one substance which, were it not
for its cost, would be far preferable to
paraffin for coil work, and that is beeswax.
Its cost, however, is generally five
times that of paraffin, even when purchased
in quantities. It never becomes brittle
enough to be damaged in careful handling,
its melting point is low, and it does not
absorb moisture. But it must be unquestionably
pure and clear.</p>

<p>In foreign practice a variety of resinous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">96</span>
mixtures are used to insulate the turns of
the wire in Ruhmkorff coils.</p>

<p>Equal parts of resin and beeswax used
hot, paraffin, resin and tallow, and shellac
and resin are employed.</p>

<p>Shellac—that is, the yellow lac—is
much used as a varnish for electrical instruments,
being dissolved in alcohol to
saturation. For dynamo armatures and
similar apparatus the shellac varnish is of
great service, and many good compounds
of shellac, such as insullac and armalac,
have been prepared for ready use. But
(excluding beeswax) for our purposes paraffin
stands pre-eminently at the head of
the list.</p>

<p>In using shellac varnish, in high tension
work more particularly, care must be
taken that the moisture has entirely evaporated.
Although a piece of shellacked apparatus
may appear perfectly dry, yet
when the current is allowed to flow unlooked-for
results may appear—it takes
hours in a dry atmosphere for shellac var<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">97</span>nish
to dry. Baking the apparatus in a
warm oven is a necessary expedient
whenever feasible, care being taken not
to burn or decompose the shellac. The
proportions most generally used are 1
ounce shellac to 5 ounces alcohol. Stand
the vessel containing the mixture in
a warm place, and shake it frequently;
filtration improves the varnish somewhat.</p>

<p>A ready and efficient varnish for silk is
prepared by mixing 6 ounces of boiled linseed-oil
and 2 ounces of rectified spirits of
turpentine. For paper, 1 part of Canada
balsam and 2 parts of spirits of turpentine
dissolved in a warm place and filtered before
being used. A good insulating cement
for Leyden jars and insulating stands is
prepared from sulphur, 100 parts; tallow, 2
parts, and resin, 2 parts, melted together
until of the consistence of syrup, and sufficient
powdered glass added to make a
paste. To be heated when applied, this
will resist most acids. The resin and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">98</span>
beeswax compound is handy when making
experimental mercurial air pumps of glass
tubes, as it has a fair tenacity, is not too
brittle, and is easily used.</p>

<small>CONDENSERS.</small></h2>
</div>

<p>A condenser is an apparatus whereby
a charge of electrical energy may be temporarily
stored, the amount of energy it
will hold determining its "capacity."
The capacity of a condenser is measured
in micro-farads, the commercial unit representing
one millionth of a farad. A
farad equals the capacity of a body raised
to the potential of one volt by a charge of
one ampere for one second at one volt—<i>i.e.</i>
= one coulomb.</p>

<p>The measurement of the capacity of a
condenser is accomplished by the use of a
ballistic galvanometer. The latter instrument
has a bell-shaped magnet suspended
in a coil of fine wire. When a momentary
current is passed through this coil the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">100</span>
magnet hardly commences to rotate until
the current has practically ceased. A
beam of light is reflected from a mirror
fixed to the magnet on to a scale. The degree
of deflection is compared with that
obtained by the discharge of a condenser
of known capacity, and the capacity of the
condenser being measured is deduced by a
simple rule. The farad, which is the unit
of capacity requiring a condenser of an
immense size, is replaced by a commercial
unit, the micro-farad—that is, one millionth
of a farad.</p>

<p>The original form of the condenser was
the Leyden jar, which owes its name from
the town of Leyden in Europe.</p>

<div class="figleft" ><a id="fig29"></a>
<img src="images/i_101.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 29.</span></div>
</div>


<p>The Leyden jar is made as follows (Fig.
29): A clean uncracked glass jar with a
wide mouth is coated on the inside and
outside with tinfoil; sometimes loose tinfoil
is filled inside, the tinfoil, however,
not reaching more than two thirds of the
jar's length from the bottom. A cork is
fitted, and through the middle of it a wire<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">101</span>
is passed touching the inside coating of
tinfoil and terminating in a metal sphere
outside. A simple Leyden
jar can be made in a
few moments by half filling
a glass bottle with
water and wetting the
lower half of the outside;
a wire run through the
cork into the water finishes
the job. But this
is at least only a makeshift,
although a fair
amount of current has
been collected from a
leather engine belt in
motion in one thus made.</p>

<p>A condenser can be easily made as follows
(Fig. 30):</p>

<div class="figright" ><a id="fig30"></a>
<img src="images/i_102.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 30.</span></div>
</div>
<p>Procure a clear glass plate, <i>G</i>, free from
flaws, 11 inches square by 3/3<sup>3</sup>∕<sub>32</sub> inch thick.
Give this a good coating of shellac varnish
all over, sides and edges. Cut out of
smooth tinfoil two sheets, <i>T</i>, 8 inches square,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">102</span>
and round off the corners with a pair of
shears. There must be no sharp corners,
projections, or angles to
induce leakage. Lay
the glass plate on a
sheet of paper, and mark
its outline thereon with
a pencil; then remove it
and substitute a sheet of
the tinfoil, and mark that. This will enable
you to centre the foil. Give one side
of the glass plate another coat of varnish,
and so lay it on the paper that its outline
coincides with the pencil outline. When
the varnish has partly dried take a sheet
of the trimmed foil, and by observing the
pencilled marks you can lay it on the varnished
plate exactly in the centre. Lay
down the top edge first along this line, and
carefully deposit the remainder of the foil
in place. Next, with a flat brush full of
varnish go over the plate, pressing out any
air bubbles, and ensuring both a flat and a
well-varnished surface. When this is dry,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">103</span>
turn over the plate and repeat the operation
on the other side.</p>

<p>If desired, a metal hemisphere of at least
an inch in diameter may be attached with
varnish, first scraping the foil to make a
contact. The whole plate can be swung in
a cradle of two silk threads, laid on a glass
tumbler, or mounted on end in a shellacked
block of wood.</p>

<p>A strip of tinfoil, <i>S</i>, attached at the corner
can be used as a connector. The
plates must be joined in the following
manner when two or more are used in
conjunction, and a quantity of current is
desired. They should be placed so the
connecting strips project alternately from
each side (Fig. 31), and all on each side
joined so as to leave two terminals, one to
the 1, 3, 5 plates, the other to the 2, 4, 6
plates, and so on, which, when joined, will
have the same effect as would result from
the use of two large plates of the same
total area. The nearer the plates are together
the greater capacity they will have,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">104</span>
always supposing the insulation is good,
the insulation being known as the dielectric.
Another good
method, when a high
quality of glass can be
procured, is to lay the
tinfoil on the plates
without varnish, piling
one on top of the other,
tinfoil and glass alternately,
and clamping the
whole securely, laying a piece of cloth top
and bottom to avoid cracking the glass from
the pressure. This must be kept from
moisture; a strip of paraffined paper stuck
along the edges and extra paraffin run on
will answer very well.</p>

<div class="figright" ><a id="fig31"></a>
<img src="images/i_104.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 31.</span></div>
</div>

<p>In constructing these glass condensers,
they must be designed to correspond with
the coil with which they are to be charged.
In the foregoing description we have allowed
a margin of 1½ inches of glass
around the foil coatings. This will make
3 inches as the maximum distance between<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">105</span>
the coatings. Although a 2-inch spark
from the coil would not jump this interval,
a certain discharge will take place, and the
less this occurs, the more serviceable the
condenser will be. Therefore a greater
margin should be allowed for a longer
spark than 2 inches.</p>

<p>In the commercial condenser for telephone
and telegraph use, paraffin and
paper are substituted for glass, as will be
described later. Heavy paraffin oil gives
excellent results, but its fluidity is disadvantageous.</p>

<p>There is no valid reason why paraffin
could not be used on the glass plate condensers,
care being observed that it is free
from dirt and metallic chips. In fact, the
space between the glass plates of the multiplate
condenser may be filled in with
paraffin, and thereby exclude the air. Only
a condenser so built up is not convenient
to take apart for experimental purposes.</p>

<p>The foregoing description of a glass in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">106</span>sulated
condenser was written with the
assumption that a good quality of glass be
used. But the ordinary window glass is
generally useless, and paraffined paper is
preferable. The quality of glass known as
"hard flint glass" is best, the superior
qualities being imported from Europe.
This latter is used in the manufacture of
the standard Leyden jar for lecture purposes.</p>

<p>Were it not for its cost, the finest dielectric
we could use would be sheet mica.
Unfortunately sheet mica over 3 inches
square is expensive, and becomes rapidly
more so as it becomes larger.</p>

<p>Standard condensers for testing are
made with mica carefully selected, and retain
the charge for the maximum length of
time. The built-up mica condenser is
immersed in molten paraffin until the same
has permeated the sheets, and then the
complete mass is put under a pressure
until the paraffin is well set.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">107</span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Paper Condenser.</span></h3>

<p>The paper used in the manufacture of
the commercial form is a special thin,
tough linen paper carefully selected, sheet
by sheet, to avoid pin-holes or flaws, and
kept in an oven until used to ensure absolute
dryness.</p>

<p>When this cannot be procured, use thin
unsized writing paper of a good quality,
well dried, and absolutely clean. As an
example of the necessity of cleanliness,
a light lead-pencil mark would serve
to conduct the current entirely from a
charged sheet to wherever it terminated,
and if suitably located, utterly destroy
the usefulness of the apparatus. Ink,
which most generally contains iron, will
cause trouble, and although some cheap
foreign condensers are built up of old
ledger pages, yet their efficiency is very
uncertain.</p>

<p>The paper used in commercial condensers
is from four to seven thousandths
of an inch in thickness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">108</span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Series.</span></h3>

<p>The smaller the amount of surface the
less will be the capacity, but the quicker
the discharge. The apparatus heretofore
mentioned has had the alternate plates
connected together in two series, presenting
a large surface and rendering a large
amount of current. A condenser so made
will have a low voltage or potential, but is
not so liable to leakage as one made to
render a high potential. The multiple
condenser of a large capacity will hardly
discharge and spark over an air gap requiring
a contact of the two electrodes.
But a smaller one, consisting only of a
single pair of small plates, will spark
across quite a considerable air gap.</p>

<p>A number of charged condensers may
be put in series, and the resultant potential
thereby increased. Cut a number of
pieces of paper of the desired size, say 6
inches square, and a number of sheets of
foil 3 inches square. Round off the corners
of the foil and build up first a sheet<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">109</span>
of paper, then a sheet of foil in its centre,
then another paper and another foil sheet,
and so on. There is to be no connection
from sheet to sheet, only the inductive
action of one on its neighbor. The foil
must be considerably smaller than the
paper in this construction, owing to the
greater tendency to discharge round the
edges of the sheets, owing to the greater
potential of the current.</p>

<p>When the requisite number of sheets
have been built up, leave a sheet of foil top
and bottom for connection, tie between
two pieces of stout card or board, and immerse
in the molten paraffin. When thoroughly
soaked, remove and put under
pressure until cold. It will be found undesirable
to make these with more than a
dozen pairs of sheets, but to make a number
of blocks of that number for ready
service.</p>

<div class="figcenter" ><a id="fig32"></a>
<img src="images/i_110.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 32.</span></div>
</div>

<p>Fig. 32 shows the arrangement of the
apparatus to charge a Leyden jar, the
plate form being connected in a similar<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">110</span>
manner. The jar is stood upon an insulating
support—a dry tumbler will answer—with
the ball <i>B</i> connected to one pole of
the coil. From the outside tinfoil coating<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">111</span>
<i>T</i> a wire runs to the discharger <i>D D</i>, which
is in circuit with the secondary coil, <i>S</i>.
The discharger balls <i>D D</i> are carefully approximated
until the spark just passes, this
latter point being of great importance.
Were the discharger balls too near the
spark would probably pierce the dielectric
of the condenser, therefore the balls should
be carefully <i>brought near</i> to each other
until the exact distance is found. Even if
the insulation of the condenser were not
pierced, yet a path would probably be
opened through which some succeeding
discharge would pass, and ruin the instrument.</p>

<p>Another method of charging is to leave
an air gap at <i>B</i>; then there is not much
liability of the condenser discharging back
through the coil—an undesirable event, as
it would most likely perforate the insulation
of the coil.</p>

<div class="figcenter" ><a id="fig33"></a>
<img src="images/i_112.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 33.</span></div>
</div>

<p>In designing or using any apparatus intended
to hold a charge of high potential, it
must be kept in mind how readily points or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">112</span>
sharp edges serve to allow the current to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">113</span>
pass off—we might almost say evaporate.
Given two bodies, one a globe and the
other a rectangular block, each well insulated
from the earth or any other large
body, and the globe would be found to
hold its charge long after the block had
dissipated all trace of the charge given to
it. Therefore round off every edge and
angle, projection or point.</p>

<p>In making handles, supports, or any
work requiring an intervening high insulation,
hard rubber is preferable to glass
where there is liability to moisture. When
the apparatus is as shown in Fig. 33, the
condenser is alternately charged and discharged
with a loud noise, the vivid sparks
passing across the discharger balls <i>D D</i>
possessing great deflagratory powers.</p>

<p>In experimenting with a Ruhmkorff coil
it is not advisable to leave the instrument
working while the secondary terminals are
beyond sparking distance, as there is a
great strain on the secondary insulation.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">114</span>
Nor is it wise to use only one electrode in
an experiment, unless the other is connected
to some apparatus of an approximate capacity
to that at the other, for the foregoing
reason.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Rolled-Up Condensers.</span></h3>

<p>Now that the condenser has become so
important a factor in telephone work, many
schemes for cheapening and facilitating
their manufacture have been devised. One
in particular merits description, the "rolled-up"
condenser having come largely into
use. The tin-foil is supplied in rolls containing
many yards of foil of the requisite width
for the condenser to be made. Likewise rolls
of paper are provided, exceeding in width,
however, those of tin-foil. These rolls are
arranged upon horizontal spindles in front
of an empty spindle, or mandrel, upon which
the condenser is to be formed. A few turns
of the paper ribbon are made around the
mandrel, then the foil is brought forward<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">115</span>
and a few turns made, then follows a turn of
paper ribbon and another of foil, and finally
a paper layer; and the mandrel being rotated,
the alternate layers of foil and paper are
laid on and rolled around each other on the
mandrel until the requisite quantity is obtained.
It then becomes an easy matter to
cut the paper ends so no contact is possible
between the layers of foil. The whole thing
is slipped off the mandrel, secured by a
rubber band or two, placed in a hot paraffin
bath, and left to become saturated while
still warm and before the paraffin has time
to harden; the cylinder is put under a press
and squeezed flat, driving out excess paraffin,
and leaving the condenser in a convenient
shape to handle. Connections are then made
to the foil leaves, and a case of wood or
metal completes the work.</p>

<p>There is no reason why aluminum foil or
lead foil, or, in fact, any thin sheet metal
should not be used in condensers. In telephone
work, paper covered with gilt paint
was tried, and worked fairly well, but was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">116</span>
ultimately rejected in favor of tin-foil. In
some cases, when it is desired to construct
a condenser for high potential work, the
oil-tank apparatus can be used. This is
readily made of any desired dimensions, as
follows: Procure a square glass jar, such
as is made for storage batteries, a few pieces
of sheet metal cut to fit loosely in the jar,
some glass rods and sufficient clean "transformer
oil" or heavy paraffin oil to nearly
fill the jar. The sheets of metal can then be
hung from the glass rods into the jar, being
separated one-half inch, and the oil poured
in. Two plates, about 8 inches by 6 inches,
will hang nicely into a type D<sup>3</sup> Chloride
Battery jar, which is 7⅞ inches long by 9½
inches high by 3¼ inches wide. Altering the
relative distances between the plates will
give considerable adjustment to this simple
condenser, or, if desired, more plates may be
inserted and connected up, as in the tin-foil
condensers. This type can be made portable,
but it is not to be recommended unless no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">117</span>
objection is had to emptying and refilling
the jar with oil.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Adjustable Condensers.</span></h3>

<p>In operating large coils, it is convenient
to be able to vary the capacity of the condenser
on the primary circuit. To make
an adjustable condenser presents no more
difficulty than a non-adjustable one, simply
more labor. For example, the large condenser
used with the 6-inch spark coil might
be divided into four sections, containing
2000 square inches, 500 square inches, 300
square inches, and 200 square inches of
surface (see Fig. 34). Wires leading from
the ends of the foil sheets <i>C C</i> are to be
brought to the brass plates <i>G G</i>. The brass
rods <i>B B</i> are connected by binding posts to
the coil, each strip being well insulated from
its neighbor. Any combination is possible
by the insertion of brass plugs in holes
drilled between the strips. The plugs must
be fully large enough to make good contact
on each of the two strips between which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">118</span>
they are inserted, and should be turned
taper. With the largest coils the condenser
and contact breaker are generally mounted
separately, and are fully adjustable.</p>

<p>Condensers made with dielectric of high
inductive capacity (insulation being equal)
will retain greater charge than those made
with dielectrics of low inductive capacity.
Thus, one made with shellac would be nearly
half as great again as with paraffin.</p>

<p>Capacity of a condenser increases with
area of foil surface, with diminished distance
between foil plates and with increase
of insulation.</p>

<small>EXPERIMENTS.</small></h2>
</div>

<p>The luminous effects that can be obtained
by means of a Ruhmkorff coil are
exceedingly beautiful and instructive.
The simplest experiment of this nature is
the production of the spark consequent on
the approximation of the electrodes attached
to the secondary coil. This spark
can be varied in both length, intensity, or
shape by the form and nature of the substances
between which it is permitted to
pass. Attach to each end of the discharger
a fine steel needle, and bring them
together until the spark jumps from one
to the other. A long thin snapping spark
will pass, which, however, appears to be
trying to take any but a straight path
across the air gap. The peculiar crooked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">121</span>ness
of this, as in a lightning flash, is credited
to the fact of particles of matter floating
in the air conducting the current better
than the pure air. The curious odor
noticed in these discharges, as, in fact, in
the working of all high-tension apparatus,
is ozone—O<sub>3</sub>, triatomic oxygen. This gas,
so noticeable after a thunderstorm, has a
powerful effect on the mucous membranes
of the throat and nasal passages, and must
be inhaled with caution. It is being used
by the medical profession for the destruction
of germs and for general therapeutic
service.</p>

<p>Substitute pieces of fine iron wire for
the needles, and bring the ends together
about one quarter the distance through
which the normal spark will pass. The
spark will be found to have changed its
appearance, now being thick and redder,
or, rather, of a deep yellow, and to possess
vast heating qualities.</p>

<p>The iron wire will melt at one electrode,
and if the other be examined it will be per<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">122</span>ceived
that it has not even become warm.
The cold wire will be the one connected
to the positive pole of the coil.</p>

<p>Connecting the poles together with a
piece of very fine iron wire will result in
the deflagration of the wire in a vivid
light.</p>

<p>The short thick spark is termed the
calorific spark, and believed to possess its
yellow color from the combustion of the
sodium in the air. This spark will easily
ignite a piece of paper held in its path.</p>

<p>Take a sheet of hard rubber and breathe
on its surface; lay a wire from each pole of
the secondary to points on the sheet, about
twice as far apart as the spark would pass
over in the air. The electric current will
strive to complete its circuit; streams of
violet light forming a perfect network will
issue from each pole, until, provided the
rubber is sufficiently damp, they will unite
in a spark far exceeding its normal length
in the air. It is curious to watch how the
streams branch out from these two points,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">123</span>
and how persistently they strive to meet
each other. Scatter some finely powdered
carbon on this sheet (crushed lead-pencil
or electric light carbon is good material).
The points may now be removed to still
further distant places, and yet the current
will work across. Each particle of carbon
seems to be provided with innumerable
scintillating diamonds, so sparkling is this
effect.</p>

<p>Hard rubber is not absolutely necessary
for these experiments; glass will do, but
the black background of the rubber intensifies
the luminosity of the discharges.
Take a teaspoonful of powdered carbon
and scatter it between the points on the
rubber, so that the spark can find a ready
path, evidenced by but little visible light.
It will be seen that this powder is blown
away from one electrode after a few minutes,
leaving the latter in the centre of a
clear space, but at the other electrode not
much disturbed.</p>

<p>Bring the points so close to one another<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">124</span>
that the spark becomes short and fat; soon
the carbon will commence to burn, forming
a veritable arc light. Take two pointed
lead-pencils and wrap a few turns of wire
from the electrodes round the blunt ends
of them; bring the pointed ends together,
and an arc will soon be established; but
at various points where the wire is wrapped
the current will burn through the wood,
and a number of incandescent points will
ensue.</p>

<p>In these experiments on the rubber sheet
it will be noticed that the spark acts as it
does in the air, inasmuch as it does not take
a direct path, but jumps in an irregular
track from point to point.</p>

<p>If two small metal balls be substituted
(Fig. 35) for the points between which the
sparks be passing, it will be noted that the
sparks do not pass through so great an air
gap as before, or even as rapidly.</p>

<p>The spark between two balls is much
noisier than that passing between points,
and if the balls be of about 1 inch in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">125</span>
diameter, a curious effect ensues on the
passage of the current (Fig. 36). This
effect has been likened to a stream of
water issuing from a horizontal nozzle into
a cavity when the nozzle is moved up and
down slowly in the space of a few inches.</p>

</div>
<p>This easily made exhibit (Fig. 37) is one
that is susceptible of quite a number of applications.
In its simple
form it is but an enlarged
version of the rubber
sheet scattered with carbon
dust. The old way
to make it was to take
a plate of glass and cement
on one face of it a sheet of tinfoil,
using shellac varnish preferably. When
dry, the tinfoil was scored across and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">126</span>
across in such manner as to divide it up
into little squares or diamonds. When
the current was applied to each end of the
plate, the spark divided into innumerable
little ones; between each bit of tinfoil and
its neighbors there would be many little
sparks, and the effect was very pretty,
somewhat as was described before when
the carbon dust was strewn between the
electrodes. It is more easily and quickly
prepared by giving a sheet of glass a coating
of shellac varnish, and then sparingly
dusting any powdered conductor over its
surface, using perhaps carbon dust or
filings of metal. By cutting out a stencil
from a piece of thin card and laying it over
the sparkling plate, the design shows out
very strikingly, and various designs in stencils
can be prepared, different powdered
conductors giving different colored sparks.</p>

<p>A long glass tube moistened inside with
mucilage or shellac varnish and then having
some conducting dust shaken through
will also give quite a pleasing effect.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">127</span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Luminous Designs.</span></h3>

<p>Coat one side of a glass plate with tinfoil,
leaving an attached strip for connection.
Shellac a piece of paper of a size corresponding
to the design to be rendered
luminous. When the shellac has dried so
far as to become "tacky," lay a sheet of
foil on it and press it down evenly all over.</p>

<p>Then draw on the paper a design that
can be readily cut out. Use a pair of scissors
or a very sharp knife. If the latter,
lay the sheet on a piece of glass; but
there is a greater tendency to tear the design
when a knife is used if an unpractised
hand wields it.</p>

<p>This design may either be stuck on to
the plain side of the glass plate with varnish
or simply laid on (Fig. 38). Connect
one secondary wire to the foil coating of
the plate and the other to the design.
This must be shown in the dark, and the
luminosity will not be strikingly apparent
until the eyes become accustomed to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">128</span>
darkness—that is, when the room has
been previously lighted.</p>

<p>One of the most beautiful and easily obtained
phenomena of the high-tension discharge
is the "electric brush" (Fig. 39).
This occurs when the secondary electrodes
of the coil are too far apart to allow of the
free passage of the spark, and can only be
seen at its best in a perfectly dark place.
The ball tips before mentioned show this
brush very plainly, or two sheets of tinfoil
in circuit hung far enough apart to prevent
vivid sparking will cause this so-called
"silent" discharge. This latter arrangement
should not be used for over fifteen
minutes, as the ozone which is liberated in
large quantities will affect those persons in
the vicinity.</p>

<div class="figleft" ><a id="fig38"></a>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">129</span></p>

<p>In fact, when a rapid vibrator is being
used with the coil, the leading wires from
the secondary terminals present this brush
appearance, the curious threads of light
resembling luminous hairs waving in the
air. The more rapid the vibrations the
more prominent the brush effect, as will
be seen in the Tesla coils. The positive
ball of the discharger shows the brush as
a spreading mass of luminous threads
reaching out toward the negative ball,
which latter resembles a star, as in the
figure.</p>

<p>The intensely disruptive power of the
long spark is readily shown by its power
to perforate substances, but great care
must be taken that the secondary wires of
a coil are led away from the body of the
coil. A good plan is to hang two silk
cords or stout threads from the ceiling, to
which the secondary wires may be attached
and kept in sight when experimenting
at any distance from the coil.</p>

<p>To pierce a piece of thin glass, take two<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">130</span>
lumps of paraffin about the size of a walnut,
and, warming them and the glass
sheet, stick them on opposite sides of
the glass facing each other. Then warm
the ends of the two pointed wires and
thrust them into the lumps of paraffin, that
they terminate on the glass surface directly
opposite each other. On connecting
these to the secondary coil a few impulses
to the contact breaker will start an electric
discharge sufficient to pierce the glass
if the thickness be proportioned to the
power of the apparatus. The great
Spottiswood coil pierced a block of glass
6 inches in thickness.</p>

<p>There is, however, a certain element of
danger to the secondary insulation in performing
this experiment.</p>

<small>SPECTRUM ANALYSIS.</small></h2>
</div>

<p>If a metal or the salt of a metal be
burned in a flame it imparts to the flame a
distinctive color; table salt thrown into
the fire burns with a yellowish flame, denoting
the presence of sodium, and a
greenish tint, indicating the combustion
of chlorine. Violet flames accompany the
burning of the salts of potassium, and
barium burns green. Lithium and strontium
give a red hue. But to be ordinarily
perceptible, the salts require for the most
part to be present in considerable quantities.
By the use of the spectroscope,
however, extremely small proportions of
these metals and salts can be readily detected
and classified.</p>

<div class="figcenter" ><a id="fig40"></a>
<img src="images/i_132.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 40.</span></div>
</div>

<p>If a beam of light be transmitted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">132</span>
through a prism of glass the rays are decomposed,
and what is known as a spectrum
is formed (Fig. 40). The most generally
observed spectrum is the rainbow.
When the light from a flame in which is
burning some suitable substance be transmitted
through the prism, the color which
predominates in the flame will predominate
in its spectrum. The combination of
a prism and tubes for observing these
effects is a spectroscope (Fig. 41). The
short fat spark from the Ruhmkorff coil is
most useful in this work. The electrodes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">133</span>
are provided with a portion of the substance
to be examined, and the spark is
passed and viewed through the spectroscope.</p>

<div class="figcenter" ><a id="fig41"></a>
<img src="images/i_133.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 41.</span></div>
</div>

<p>The spectroscope is shown in connection
with the coil in Fig. 41. <i>A</i> is the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">134</span>
aperture in the screen through which the
rays from the metal burning at the discharger
balls <i>D D</i> passes. The lens at <i>L</i>
is used to view these rays after they have
been decomposed by the prism <i>P</i>, which,
as well as the lens, can be rotated. <i>I</i> is
the coil, <i>P P</i> the primary and <i>S S</i> the secondary
wires, <i>C</i> being a condenser bridged
across the circuit.</p>

<p>The screen should be pierced by a very
narrow aperture, <i>A</i>, and be placed at a
considerable distance from the prism <i>P</i>,
that the rays issuing through the aperture
may not strike the prism until they have
widely diverged and become separated
from each other. The aperture is practically
formed of perfectly parallel knife
edges, forming a slit not exceeding one
hundredth of an inch in width.</p>

<p>The colored spaces in the solar spectrum
do not occupy an equal extent of
area; the violet is the most extended, the
orange the least. The proportion is in
three hundred parts: Violet, 80; green,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">135</span>
60; yellow, 48; red, 45; indigo, 40;
orange, 27.</p>

<p>The solar rays exhibit on careful examination
dark lines crossing the spectrum at
right angles to the order of the colors, and
always occupying the same relative positions.
These are called Fraunhofer's
lines.</p>

<p>If, however, the spectra of metals,
gases, and other elements be examined
they will be found to present certain characteristic
<i>bright</i> lines, the body of the spectrum
being often feeble or entirely dark.
The spectrum of hydrogen gives two very
bright lines of red and orange.</p>

<p>An extremely minute quantity of an element
is necessary to give distinct lines.
Sodium gives a single or double line of
yellow light in a position agreeing with
that of the orange rays in the solar spectrum.</p>

<p>Potassium gives a red line in the red
end and a violet line in the violet end of
the solar spectrum. Strontium presents<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">136</span>
eight bright lines; calcium gives mainly
one broad green band and one bright
orange band.</p>

<p>In practical work with the spectroscope
a solar spectrum is often arranged that it
can be used as a comparison with the spectrum
being investigated, one spectrum
being formed above the other, and the observation
made as to which lines coincide.
Iron gives nearly sixty bright lines coinciding
with the same number of dark lines
of the solar spectrum.</p>

<p>The violet rays of the solar spectrum
are the rays which possess the maximum
chemical action, the yellow the maximum
light effect, the red the maximum heating
effect. Beyond the violet band of the
spectrum exist certain rays termed the invisible
rays or ultra-violet rays, which in
themselves are not luminous. Their vibratory
rate is higher and their wave length
shorter than the violet rays, according to
the most generally accepted theory of
light. These rays, when passed through<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">137</span>
certain substances, suffer a change and become
visible in a luminous state of the substance,
which luminosity is termed fluorescence.</p>

<p>The bright yellow line of sodium in the
orange rays is found in nearly all spectra,
owing to its extensive diffusion in the atmosphere.</p>

<p>Tesla has succeeded in producing electric
waves of length approximating to
those of white light, which appear to have
very little heat. The ideal light is that
which shows no heat and does not liberate
noxious gases in the air, and were it not for
its feeble luminosity, the light of the electric
spark passing through a carbonic acid vacuum
would approximate this most nearly.</p>

<p>The present mode of obtaining light—that
of raising to a high temperature some
substance or collection of particles—seems
certainly somewhat antiquated. The following
notes may be of interest and assistance
in researches bearing on the lighting
question.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding it requires an intensely
high potential to enable the current

connected with
high-tension discharges in
vacuo, a description of
a few forms of simple mercurial
air pumps will be
serviceable.</p>

<p>Fig. 42: If a glass tube,
<i>F</i>, stopped at one end, 3
feet long or over, be filled
with mercury and the
open end immersed in a
vessel of mercury, <i>T</i>, the
column of metal in the
tube will sink until it attains
a height, <i>M</i>, of about
30 inches, varying according
to the condition of the atmosphere.</p>

<p>The space between the mercury column
and the top of the tube will be a fairly
good vacuum. This fact was noted many<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">142</span>
years ago, and the gradual evolution of
the mercurial air-pump based on this result
can be followed in the articles on the
mercurial air-pump by Silvanus P. Thompson,
read before the Society of Arts, England,
some years ago.</p>

<p>Geissler, the first manufacturer of the
"Geissler" or vacuum tube for electrical
research, seeing the inconvenience of the
above-described operation and the meagre
results obtained, invented the pump called
by his name (Fig. 43).</p>

<p><i>F E</i> is a stout glass tube some 3 feet
long, having a bulb, <i>B</i>, at its upper extremity,
and a rubber tube, <i>S</i>, attached to the
curved end. A reservoir of mercury, <i>R</i>,
connects with this rubber tube, and a special
glass tap is fixed in the upper end of
the glass tube at <i>E</i>, beyond which tap
being the point of attachment for the object
to be exhausted. The operation is as
follows: On turning the tap a part of the
way it allows a passage between the tube
<i>F E</i> and the atmosphere. The reservoir<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">143</span>
<i>R</i> is then raised until the mercury flows
into the bulb and up the tube to the tap.
The tap is then turned a fraction, and the
communication with the air is shut off and
opened between the object to be exhausted
and the tube <i>F E</i>. The reservoir is
then lowered and the mercury falls, drawing
down the air from the object into the
tube. The tap is then turned as in the
first place, and the reservoir <i>R</i> raised,
when the air drawn into the tube is forced
out by the rising column of metal. This
operation being repeated many times,
withdraws nearly all the air from the object—in
fact, makes a fairly good vacuum.
This pump has been much modified from
the simple form described.</p>

<p>The form of pump most used in the
United States lamp factories is based on
the application of the piston-like action of
a quantity of mercury dropping down a
tube. This is known as the Sprengel
pump, after the inventor.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a id="fig43"></a>
<img src="images/i_144.jpg"  alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap gap10">Fig. 43.</span> <span class="smcap">Fig. 44.</span></div>
</div>
<p>Fig. 44: <i>F</i> is a stout glass tube about<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">144</span>
40 inches long by one-twelfth of an inch<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">145</span>
internal diameter, carrying the reservoir
funnel <i>R</i> at the top, a piece of soft rubber
tubing, <i>S</i>, nipped by a pinch-cock being
interposed to admit of the regulation of
the mercurial drops. The lower end of
this "fall tube," as it is called, is immersed
in mercury contained in a suitable
vessel, <i>V</i>, a branch tube being blown or
cemented into the fall tube to admit of the
connection of the object to be exhausted
at <i>E</i>. <i>S</i> is another piece of rubber tubing
with a pinch-cock regulation. The point
<i>H</i> is the normal barometric height of the
mercury—about 30 inches. On attaching
a bulb, for example, at <i>E</i>, and regulating
the pinch-cock at the top of the fall tube <i>F</i>,
a succession of drops of mercury falls
down the tube, each drop acting as a piston
to drive the air before it, sucking the
same from the bulb, and forcing it down
through the tube and vessel out into the
atmosphere.</p>

<p>On its first being set into operation, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">146</span>
cushions of air between the drops silence
their fall; but as a higher degree of rarefaction
occurs, the air cushions become
insufficient, and the drops fall with a sharp
click on the top of the barometric column.</p>

<p>One great disadvantage in this form of
pump is the tendency to fracture of the
glass tube that is manifested by the concussion
of the drops of mercury at the
barometric height. However, this has to
a certain extent been obviated in later
forms of this useful and efficient pump.</p>

<p>For many electrical experiments, the
simple exhaust tube (Fig. 42) mentioned
at the beginning of the article will be found
very satisfactory. The top end need not
necessarily be sealed off with glass, a cork
having a wire, <i>W</i>, run through for connection
being driven in, and a coat of paraffin
or one of the cements mentioned in a later
chapter be laid on.</p>

<p>The second electrical connection is made
by a wire dipping in the tumbler of mercury.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">147</span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Discharges in Vacuo.</span></h3>

<p>In a simple glass tube having two wires
carrying balls inserted through its ends,
from which the air has been partially exhausted,
the study of the changes shown
by the passage of the spark is extremely
interesting. Before the commencement
of exhaustion no luminous effect can be
discerned; at a low degree of exhaustion
a luminosity appears between the ends of
the wires, the negative pole being surrounded
by a violet glow and a larger
pear-shaped red discharge from the positive.
An interval near the negative electrode
is in darkness, widening as the exhaustion
progresses. When the degree of
exhaustion is very high, a series of arches
concentric with the positive ball appear
and become broader and more distinct as
the rarefaction progresses. The arches or
bands are called striæ, and are most distinct
when the tube is made in the form of
a narrow cylinder, with a bulb at each end.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">148</span>
Carbonic acid gas vacua give the best results.
If the finger be placed on the bulb
at either end a luminous spot appears, and
by using a very rapid contact breaker in
the primary circuit, the luminous discharges
become highly sensitive, being
diverted from their regular path on the
approach of the hand, a magnet, or a
grounded wire. An extended treatment
of these phenomena would be out of place
here, but can be found in nearly all comprehensive
works on electricity.</p>

<p>If an incandescent-lamp bulb be held in
the hand and one end be brought near to
a terminal of the coil, a beautiful bluish
light appears.<a id="FNanchor_2_2" href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">2</a> The carbon filament, if
long, and not held by its loop, becomes
electrified and oscillates, often giving out
a clear, high, bell-like sound as it strikes
the glass. Particles of carbon deposited
on the glass during the burning of the
lamp, shown in daylight as a blackening
deposit, generally show little sparks, like
stars scattered over the inside of the globe.</p>

<div class="footnotes">
<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_2_2" href="#FNanchor_2_2" class="label">2</a>
This depends on the degree of exhaustion.</p></div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">149</span></p>

<p>A vacuum tube will phosphoresce if
held in the hand near a secondary terminal,
or even if laid on the table near the
coil, and will light quite brilliantly if one
end be held against a terminal. This latter
method, however, is generally inconvenient,
as a certain amount of physical
pain ensues from the discharge into the
skin.</p>

<p>Different gases in the tubes give characteristic
colors. In carbonic acid gas the
whitish green hue prevails; in hydrogen,
white and red; in nitrogen, orange yellow.
The characteristic spectra are given
by the gases in the tubes, and can be
readily examined in the spectroscope.
But there is sometimes a slight variation
in these colors, dependent upon changes in
the current.</p>

<p>In many Geissler tubes, a portion of the
bulbs is made of uranium glass. On the
passage of the spark in the tube this glass
glows with a magnificent emerald green
hue. Other tubes are constructed with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">150</span>
an outside enveloping glass tube fitted
with a corked orifice into which can be
poured different solutions.</p>

<small>ROTATING EFFECTS.</small></h2>
</div>

<p>Although the luminous discharges in
the exhausted tubes are extremely beautiful,
yet the effect is indescribably enhanced
when the tubes are rotated. Gassiot's star
was the name given to the earliest exhibit
of a rotating tube carrying a luminous discharge,
owing to the curious phenomenon
ensuing from the interruptions of the spark.
As the human retina is only capable of retaining
an impression for a fraction of a
second, and as the tube is only momentarily
luminous during the passage of the
spark, the effect of the revolving tube is
that of a series of such arranged as the
radii of a circle, the number apparent,
being governed by the rapidity of rotation
and the rate of interruption of the current.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">154</span></p>

<div class="figcenter" ><a id="fig49"></a>
<img src="images/i_154.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 49.</span></div>
</div>

<p>Fig. 49 represents a form of rotating
wheel which is easily made, and yet susceptible
of many novel and attractive
effects. Such a wheel, placed in a store
window, would undoubtedly attract many
persons by the beautiful variations of col<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">155</span>ored
figures which it presents while in
motion. And once a crowd is collected
and its attention attracted to one spot, the
capabilities of advertising the goods on
sale are apparent.</p>

<p>A pasteboard or light wooden disk <i>D</i>,
3 feet in diameter or over, is mounted on
a shaft, <i>S</i>, operated by an electric motor
or such power as may be attainable. Upon
its surface are mounted the tube-holders
<i>T T T T</i>, connected, as shown, by wires
leading from the secondary of the Ruhmkorff
coil. Starting at the shaft <i>S</i>, the circuit
runs to the first tube-holder, where
the continuity of the wire is broken to
allow of the attachment of the vacuum
tube. From the first tube-holder the wire
runs in turn to each of the other three
tube-holders, terminating at <i>R</i>, where it
passes through a hole to a metal ring on
the back of the disk shown by the dotted
circle. This ring and the shaft are in connection
with the secondary coil, by reason
of its electrodes being attached to two<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">156</span>
brushes or strips of metal pressing, one on
the ring, the other on the shaft; or the
bearing in which the shaft turns may displace
one of the brushes. <i>W W</i> are two
counterbalance weights, that the wheel
may run smoothly and be not affected by
the irregular distribution of the tubes or
its surface. <i>E E</i> are elastic bands, looped
over the wire and through rings in the
disk, that the wires may not be liable to
touch or short circuit.</p>

<p>At Fig. 50 is an enlarged view of a tube-holder,
although, as it is meant only as a
diagram, considerable variation of design
is permissible. The springs at <i>H H</i>, to
which the wires run, being bent back, the
metal pins <i>P P</i> may be thrust through the
rings on the ends of the tube, and the elasticity
and pressure of the spring will hold
it in place and make the necessary contact.
A wooden block, <i>B</i>, secured to the
face of the disk, is provided with a thumb-screw,
<i>S</i>, securing the tube-holder to it,
by means of which the tube-holders may<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">157</span>
be turned a trifle upon their axes and so
vary the effect of the wheel.</p>

<div class="figcenter" ><a id="fig50"></a>
<img src="images/i_157.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap gap10">Fig. 50.</span> <span class="smcap">Fig. 51.</span></div>
</div>

<p>Fig. 51 is a side view of the wheel, showing
one manner of mounting the disk and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">158</span>
its connections. The same figures apply
to the parts as in the preceding figure.
<i>M N</i> are the wires leading to the coil, <i>P</i> is
a pulley on the shaft whereby the rotary
power may be applied. The wires on the
face of the disk are not shown, as they
would impair the clearness of the diagram
unnecessarily.</p>

<p>The greatest danger in the operation of
such a piece of apparatus will be the tendency
of the high tension spark to wander
where it is not wanted, and to take short
but forbidden paths back to the coil. However,
care and perhaps experiment will
prove the remedy. It will be noticed by
reference to Fig. 49 that a circle has been
drawn almost bisecting two of the tube-holders.
This circle represents a circle of
danger, and where a thin material has been
used for the disk, the disk may very well
be reinforced by a piece of stouter card
cemented on its face.</p>

<p>The disk, whether of wood or of pasteboard,
must have a liberal coating of in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">159</span>sulation,
either shellac varnish, paraffin,
or beeswax, and be absolutely free from
unnecessary holes. Moreover, the ring <i>R</i>
must be of such a distance from the support
<i>F</i>, if the latter be metal, as will preclude
any jumping of the spark. A Ruhmkorff
coil giving upward of three quarters
of an inch of spark will be large enough
to operate a wheel carrying four 8-inch
tubes.</p>

<p>The wheel may be set back in a window
and surrounded by dark fabrics, or built
in, as it were, in a cave of such. The
judicious use of pieces of looking-glass scattered
on the sides of the cave, in such
manner as to reflect the light of the tubes,
will enhance the effect. There is no danger
of fire where ordinary care is used, as
the <i>long</i> spark necessary to the production
of the luminosity will hardly ignite anything
but gas, unless specially arranged to
do so.</p>

<p>Fig. 52 is a triangle formed of three
Geissler tubes, and intended for rotation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">160</span>
as a whole. <i>M M</i> are two pieces of mica
or glass, to prevent any possibility of the
spark jumping and short circuiting, in
which event the tubes would fail to light.</p>

<div class="figcenter" ><a id="fig52"></a>
<img src="images/i_160.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 52.</span></div>
</div>

<p>This triangle is shown diagrammatically
at <i>A B C</i>, Fig. 53, mounted on an insulated
rotating disk. Before commencement of
rotation, and upon the current being turned
on to the tubes, a simple triangle will result,
but at a certain stage of rotation the
Maltese cross shown is formed. A still
higher rate of rotation will produce the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">161</span>
double star, Fig. 54, and as the rotation and
rate of vibration of the coil contact-breaker
is varied, an apparently endless succession
of stars or triangles appears to grow out
into view.</p>

<div class="figleft" ><a id="fig53"></a>

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 54.</span></div>
</div>

<p>Although Figs. 53 and 54 serve to illustrate
a triangle of tubes and its variations,
a very pretty and simple effect can
be obtained with it as follows: Three
strips of looking-glass are cut and scratched
across their silvered surface, as described
for the luminous pane, Fig. 37. The current
then being allowed to pass, and the
wheel being rotated, the triangle acts as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">162</span>
in the preceding paragraphs, multiplying
and forming figures, which are extremely
interesting to watch.</p>

<p>While treating on the subject of store-window
attractions, a few suggestions on
a display of stationary Geissler tubes may
be made. Starting with the assumption
that the platform on which the goods
would be displayed is of wood, a very
small amount of preparation is necessary.
The platform is covered with a dark material
free from gloss, such as canton flannel,
on which the tubes are laid in any fancy
pattern, or may be scattered haphazard.
Fine bare wire (No. 36 B. &amp; S. is not any
too small) is run from tube to tube, using
care that it does not touch itself in such
manner as to short circuit the current.
There is not much necessity to cover the
wires, unless the rate of vibration of the
contact be so rapid as to show the brush
discharge from the wire strands. In a
jewelry store the cylindrical portions of
the tubes may be covered with strips of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">163</span>
dark cloth, concealing all but the bulbs.
The Uranium bulbs will resemble emeralds;
the yellow bulbs, topaz; and the blue,
turquoise—certainly a very striking collection
of gems. A few diamond-shaped
pieces of the foil-coated glass scratched
across, by the whiteness of the tiny sparks
will aid to set off the whole. The outfit is
not expensive: a coil giving a one half inch
spark will light from four to six tubes to
great brilliancy. Cloths with metallic
threads woven in them must not be used,
nor any of the metallic powders known in
the trade as "glitters."</p>

<small>GAS LIGHTING.</small></h2>
</div>

<p>When it is desired to light clusters of
gas jets situated in inaccessible places, or
a number of them simultaneously, this
method finds ready application. It operates
in the division of a long spark among
a number of burners, the gas being turned
on at the main and the primary circuit of a
Ruhmkorff coil closed and opened until the
succession of sparks ignites the gas, Fig. 55.
There are various commercial forms of
these burners, prominent among which is
the "Smith jump spark" burner.</p>

<div class="figcenter" ><a id="fig55"></a>
<img src="images/i_165.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 55.</span></div>
</div>

<p>A lava tip is provided with a mica or
isinglass flange midway between the tip
and the lower end of the burner. This
flange isolates the electrodes from any possibility
of the spark straying away to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">165</span>
metallic pillar in which the burner is inserted.
The multiple lava tip burner is intended
for use where a very short burner is
needed, also for flash rings multiple lights.
Here the tips are placed close enough together
to ignite by contagion. In this
case one of the common tips is removed
from the ring and a multiple lava tip substituted.
It is customary to allow sixteen
burners to one inch of spark. Any num<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">166</span>ber
of series can be operated alternately
by means of a suitable switch.</p>

<p>The wire used to connect the burners is
generally bare copper, and as small in
diameter as will sustain its own weight
without injury, the amount of the current
being infinitesimal. It is supported on
porcelain or glass knobs screwed to the
wall or ceiling, being carefully planned to
avoid any metallic substances to which
the spark might be tempted to escape. In
wiring chandeliers, the wire is run through
glass tubes wherever there is any liability
of its coming near the metal pipes. There
is a very great danger of this jumping of
the spark where it is not wanted, and the
utmost care must be taken in planning the
course the wires shall take. Even a damp
wall will cause trouble or a gilt cornice,
although the latter may be entirely insulated
from the ground. The switch
bases for the groups of circuits must be of
hard rubber, and the switch points and
levers be placed so far apart that there is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">167</span>
no liability of the spark jumping, which
it certainly will do if it gets a chance.
Ordinary insulated wires are ineffectually
protected by the rubber compounds used.
Glass, mica, and better still, a large air
gap are the only insulations that will serve,
for the tremendous potential or voltage of
the current must be carefully considered
whenever insulation is necessary. The coil
is better provided with a spring key in the
primary circuit than a vibrator, it gives
better control of the circuit and probably
a larger and better spark.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Gas Lighting in Multiple.</span></h3>

<p>The spark which occurs at the contact
breaker of a Ruhmkorff coil is held in check
by the condenser; were no condenser used,
it would possess considerable powers of
combustion. Using a large primary coil
and a few cells of open circuit battery, this
spark is made to pass across the path of
a gas jet, which it instantly ignites. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">168</span>
contact breaker consists of a platinum point,
fixed on the gas tip, and a German silver
spring, carried on a lever, which latter is
pulled across the tip so as to make and break
the circuit at the burner orifice. Some
burners are provided with a ratchet arrangement,
by which pulling the lever once turns
on and lights the gas, pulling again turns
it off; others require the gas to be turned
on first.</p>

<div class="figcenter" ><a id="fig56"></a>
<img src="images/i_169.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 56.</span></div>
</div>

<p>Reference to Fig. 56 will show the
connections to two burners <i>P P</i> and an
automatic burner <i>A</i>, to be described later.
The coil <i>C</i> is a core of soft iron, about
¾ inch diameter and eight to ten inches long,
wound with from two to four pounds of
magnet wire, Nos. 12 or 14 B &amp; S. One
side of the battery goes to ground or to the
gas pipe, thus forming the return circuit.
The wiring on the fixtures is done with
No. 20 to 24 B &amp; S gas fixture wire, insulated
with four windings of silk or cotton.
This is fastened to the lacquered brass work
by means of thick shellac varnish, it being<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">169</span>
tied on first with thread, which can readily
be removed when shellac is dry and hard.
The wire is held on the insulated collar of
the burner by a small nut and screw, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">170</span>
great care must be taken to ensure no
grounding. The setting up of a gas-lighting
outfit is extremely simple, but it often fails
for want of care. There must be the best
possible insulation between wire and metal
work.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Automatic Burners.</span></h3>

<p>There are several forms of these burners,
but the principle of all is the same. A gas
burner protrudes from the top of a brass
case which encloses the actuating mechanism.
This mechanism consists of two
electromagnets, the armature of one opening
a valve and allowing the gas to flow, at
the same time vibrating a platinum-tipped
rod, which produces a series of sparks at the
burner tip. These sparks ignite the gas, and
a second magnet is provided to shut off the
flow of gas, thus extinguishing the light.
Some devices use one electromagnet for
both lighting or extinguishing, but the
majority are with double magnets. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">171</span>
circuit is worked from a push button situated
at any desired location, and having a
white and black button, one for lighting
and the other for extinguishing. The principal
automatic burners are the Holtzer, the
Boston, and the Bartholdi, between which
there lies little choice, so admirably are they
constructed.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Bartholdi Automatic Burner.</span></h3>

<p>Instead of a rotating stop-cock, as in
other automatics, a gravity valve is employed
in the Bartholdi, which is held to its
seat by the weight of the armature and
connecting stem, as shown in Fig. 57. When
the gas is turned off the valve rests upon
its seat, as indicated in the cut. By a closure
of the electric circuit at the turn-on button,
two of the helices <i>M P</i> are energized, causing
the armature <i>J</i> to be lifted, thus, by
means of the stem <i>H</i>, raising the valve <i>G</i>
from its seat into the dotted position, and
opening the gas way so that the gas may<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">172</span>
issue to the tip, as shown by the arrows.
At the same time, the top of the valve strikes
against the end of the lever <i>W</i>, causing the
circuit to be broken at the spark points <i>T U</i>,
resulting in a continuous sparking as long
as the finger presses the button. The magnet<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">173</span>
when raising the armature has also twisted
or partially revolved it, so as to bring the
notch <i>d</i> in the armature over the end of the
hook <i>e</i>, as shown in dotted lines. When
the circuit is broken by lifting the finger
from the button the notch falls into the
hook and the valve is locked open.</p>

</div>
<p>To extinguish the flame the turn-off
button is pressed, when a second magnet
(not shown in cut) lifts the armature
and twists it in the opposite direction, so
that when the circuit is broken the armature
falls free to its normal position, closing the
valve.</p>

<p>In wiring up an automatic burner it is
necessary to run two wires to it, one from
the white button and another from black
button on push plate <i>S</i>. Reference to Fig. 58
will make this clear. Most burners are
provided with two binding posts inside the
brass case, and the wires are run through
a rubber-bushed hole in the base. If the
push has already been set in position and
wired up, as per Fig. 58, have the buttons<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">174</span>
pressed alternately, when on touching the
binding posts on automatic with the wires,
the lighting or extinguishing connection is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">175</span>
easily selected. The lighting armature in
most automatic burners buzzes violently,
while the extinguishing one only strikes once
on contact being made. Fig. 58 shows how
to connect up two pushes to one automatic,
one push, perhaps, being located downstairs
and the other upstairs in the case of a
hall lamp. In setting up these burners care
must be taken not to bend contacts or
alter adjustment, and absolute precaution
is necessary that no crosses or weakly insulated
places are in circuit. After burning
for some time it often happens that the
burner refuses to light, only buzzing feebly
or not at all. If feebly, the trouble is in
battery, which should consist of, at least,
four or six cells of open circuit battery with
low internal resistance, such as Samson-Law
carbon cylinder, or for occasional use large,
dry cells.</p>

<p>If no click is heard on pressing white
button, examine all connections; if still no
trouble is found, examine the platinum
break. The platinum tip may be bent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">176</span>
by the continual hammering against the
platinum tip on vibrating rod, preventing
contact on collar, or that soot has formed
there. These are the commonest maladies
of automatic burners, and can be easily
remedied by readjusting platinum tip and
cleaning. Contacts here must be clean. In
general wiring use waterproof office wire or,
better still, rubber-covered wire; for fixtures
use the fixture wire before described. When
shellacking the wire to the fixture don't
attempt to connect up batteries until the
shellac is dry and hard, say for half a day.
Electric gas-lighting is fruitful of trouble
if the work is not well done. Another cause
of trouble may arise from a dirty burner not
allowing the gas to strike near the contact
(clean the burner), or the collar carrying
contact may have shifted, perhaps short-circuited;
it should be insulated with a thin
strip of asbestos. Although white lead at
the joints makes a fairly good contact, some
persons prefer to use tin-foil, a piece of foil
being worked around screw thread and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">177</span>
burner screwed on; it prevents leaks as well
as lead if well done, and makes better contact.
As a short circuit on the wires will
cause all the burners to fail, many devices
have been invented to open the circuit upon
such an occurrence. These will be found described
in the catalogues of electrical stores;
they do not come within the province of this
book for description.</p>

<small>BATTERIES FOR COILS.</small></h2>
</div>

<p>In selecting a battery to operate the
coil, one is needed which will supply a
large steady current for a considerable
period. Although the primary circuit is
opened and closed rapidly, yet the class
known as open circuit cells is not suitable,
even though they have a low internal resistance,
and thereby render a large current.
Such cells are only suitable for the
uses for which they are mostly designed,
bell-ringing or annunciator work. There
is one case, however, where an open circuit
cell may be used with an induction
coil, and that is in gas lighting as previously
described; but here a dozen or so
impulses of current are generally sufficient,
followed by long periods of rest. For the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">179</span>
latter work the cells in common use are
the Samson, Champion, and Monarch, all
of which are of low internal resistance and
great recuperative power.</p>

<p>The reason that such cells will not work
for long periods, is that they polarize.
This latter action takes place in these open
circuit cells, which are of the Leclanché
type as follows: A positive plate of zinc
is immersed in a solution of ammonium
chloride (or salammoniac), and a negative
plate of carbon and peroxide of manganese,
contained either in a porous cup or
compressed into a block also stands in the
solution. Care is taken that these two
plates do not touch each other. When the
outside circuit is closed the zinc combines
with the chlorine of the solution liberating
free hydrogen and ammonia. The hydrogen
appears at the negative plate, where
it is acted upon by the oxygen of the peroxide
of manganese to form water.</p>

<p>But when the circuit is of too low resistance,
the oxidizing action of the peroxide<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">180</span>
of manganese is not rapid enough, and a
film of hydrogen, which is a poor conductor,
forms over the negative plate, increasing
the internal resistance of the cell and
setting up local action.
In the best class of these
open circuit cells, this
hydrogen is absorbed
after a rest, and the battery
recuperates and is
ready for work again.
The circuit of the Ruhmkorff
coil is low, and
this polarization always
occurs a few minutes
after the contact-breaker
is started.</p>

<div class="figleft" ><a id="fig59"></a>
<img src="images/i_180.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 59.</span></div>
</div>

<p>In the class of closed
circuit cells, chosen for
the present purpose, the Grenet or bottle
bichromate is one of the handiest
for occasional use. A glass bottle-shaped
jar, <i>J</i>, Fig. 59, is provided with a hard
rubber cap, <i>G</i>, on which are mounted the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">181</span>
binding posts <i>A B</i>. To the underside of
this cap are attached two carbon plates
<i>C C</i>, which reach nearly to the bottom of
the jar, being connected together on the
cap by a varnished copper strip, the latter
being in turn connected to one binding
post. Through the centre of the cap
passes a brass rod, <i>R</i>, having attached to
its lower end a piece of sheet zinc, <i>Z</i>, well
amalgamated with mercury. This process
of amalgamation consists in cleaning the
zinc, then rubbing its surface with a rag
dipped in dilute sulphuric acid, and pouring
a few drops of mercury on the wet
zinc. The mercury will spread readily
over the zinc, provided it has been well
cleaned, and if properly done should give
the zinc plate a bright, shining appearance.</p>

<p>When the cell is not in use, the zinc is
drawn up into the neck of the bottle and
clamped by a set screw against the brass
rod. A copper spring pressing on the rod
serves to carry the current to the second
binding post.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">182</span></p>

<p>This cell originated in France, whence
its name, but a cheaper form is now made
in the United States known as the Novelty
Grenet. The shape of the jar is somewhat
different, and the carbon is moulded,
whereas the French carbon is sawed from
the carbon deposited in the gas retort;
but the American form is practically of as
great utility as the French, and the cost
recommends it.</p>

<p>The bichromate solutions are affected by
light, and deteriorate less it kept in stoneware
jugs. The Grenet battery can very
well be fitted into a neat wood case, which
will serve the further purpose of preventing
chance knocks from fracturing the
glass jar.</p>

<p>Carbons which are used in batteries containing
the foregoing solution should be
well washed in warm water whenever the
solution is changed, and especially when
it is intended to put the battery out of
active service. When the solution acquires
a decidedly green hue it should be re<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">183</span>placed
with fresh. The electromotive
force of this cell varies from 1.90 to 2
volts, and the amperage is dependent on
the size of the plates, running from 5 amperes
upward.</p>

<p>The glass jar is filled up to the commencement
of the neck with a solution of
bichromate of potash or sodium, called
electropoion fluid, and prepared as follows:
To 1 gallon of water add 1 pound
of bichromate of sodium, mixing in a stoneware
vessel. When dissolved add 3 pounds
of sulphuric acid in a thin stream, stirring
slowly. As the mixture heats on the introduction
of the acid, care must be used
to pour in the latter slowly. This solution
should not be used until quite cold.</p>

<p>The sodium salt is preferable to the
potassium, owing to its not forming the
crystals of chrome alum, and also on account
of its lower cost and greater solubility,
the latter being four times greater
than that of the potassium salt. The commercial
acid used should contain at least<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">184</span>
90 per cent pure acid and should be free
from impurities. On filling the battery
use utmost care not to splash the solution
on any of the metal work, or it will cause
corrosion. Although the salts in the solution
will most likely make a stain, the corrosive
action of the acid can be arrested
if the solution be
splashed on the
clothes by the prompt
application of ammonia
solution.</p>

<div class="figleft" ><a id="fig60"></a>
<img src="images/i_184.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 60.</span></div>
</div>

<p>The "Fuller" cell,
Fig. 60, which is another
type of the bichromate
cell, is one
from which a steady
current can be obtained for a longer interval
than from the Grenet, but the current
is less. The electromotive force is
the same, but the current is only 3 amperes,
except in certain modifications.</p>

<p>In the porous cup is a cone-shaped zinc
having a stout copper wire cast in. This<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">185</span>
wire is occasionally covered with rubber
insulation, but, as a rule, is bare. The
porous cup is of unglazed porcelain, thick,
but very porous. This sets in the glass
jar, a wooden cover fitting <i>loosely</i> over the
whole to exclude dust. Through this
cover passes the wire leading from the
zinc, and also the carbon plate carrying a
machine screw and check nuts for connection.
The cover is dipped in melted paraffin,
as is also the upper end of the carbon
and the rim of the glass jar. This is to
prevent the creeping of the salts in the
solutions and the corrosion of the brass
work.</p>

<p>Into the porous cup is poured a solution
composed of 18 parts by weight of common
salt and 72 parts by weight of water.
Electropoion fluid is held by the glass jar,
the two solutions reaching a level of two
thirds the height of the jar. One ounce
of mercury is added to the porous cup
solution to ensure the complete and continuous
amalgamation of the zinc. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">186</span>
salt can be more readily dissolved in warm
water, but <i>all</i> solutions must be used <i>cold</i>.
It is not always necessary to renew the
solutions when the battery fails to give
out its accustomed strength, but several
ounces of water can be substituted for a
similar amount of fluid in the porous cup.
Stir the solution by moving the zinc up
and down, and a temporary improvement
will be noticed.</p>

<p>To obtain a greater current from this
cell, use a larger zinc, such as a well-amalgamated
zinc plate, and add a teaspoonful
of sulphuric acid to clean water for the
porous cup solution. Additional carbon
plates connected together and placed
round the porous cup will lower the resistance
of the cell and increase the current,
and also tend to keep down the polarization.</p>

<p>A new form of this battery was described
by M. Morisot a short time ago.</p>

<p>The positive pole is of retort carbon in
the outer cell in a depolarizing mixture<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">187</span>
made of 1 part sulphuric acid, 3 parts saturated
solution bichromate of potash, crystals
of the latter salt being suspended in
the cell to keep up the saturation. A porous
cup contains a solution of caustic soda.
The zinc is in a second porous cup placed
within the first, which holds a caustic soda
solution of greater density. The electromotive
force is 2½ volts when the cell is
first placed in circuit, and will remain at
2.4 for some hours. The internal resistance
is low, but varies with the thickness
of the porous cups. This cell is not suitable
for any but use for a few hours at one
time.</p>

<p>The Dun cell has a negative electrode of
a carbon porous cup filled with broken
carbon. The zinc is in the form of a heavy
ring, and hangs at the top of the solution
in the outer jar. Permanganate of potash
crystals are placed in the porous cup, and
the entire cell filled with a solution of caustic
potash 1 part to water 5 parts. The
voltage is 1.8, and the internal resist<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">188</span>ance
being low the resultant current is
large.</p>

<p>A cell with an electrode of aluminum in
a solution of caustic potash and carbon in
strong nitric acid in porous cup is claimed
to have an electromotive force of 2.8, but
the nitric acid is not a desirable acid to
handle.</p>

<p>Metallic magnesium in a salammoniac
solution with a copper plate in a hydrochloric
acid and sulphate of copper mixture
is of high voltage, nearly 3 volts
being obtained, and the current is large,
but it is a new combination and has not as
yet stood the test of time.</p>

<p>There are other formulæ for solutions to
be used in Fuller or Grenet cells which
may be useful to the experimenter.
Trouvé's is as follows: Water, 36 parts;
bichromate of potash, 3 parts; sulphuric
acid, 15 parts, all by weight. Bottone's:
Chromic acid, 6 parts; water, 20 parts;
chlorate of potassium (increases electromotive
force), ⅓ part; sulphuric acid, 3<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">189</span>½
parts, all by weight. A convenient "red
salt" or "electric sand": Sulphate of
soda, 14 parts; sulphuric acid, 68 parts;
bichromate of potash, 29 parts; soda dissolved
in heated acid, and potash stirred
in slowly. When cold can be broken up
and prepared when required by dissolving
in five times its weight of water.</p>

<p>The chromic acid used in Bottone's solution
is very soluble in water, it being possible
to dissolve five or six times the
amount in the same quantity of water as
of bichromate of potash. The simple solution
of chromic acid is 1 pound to 1 pint
of water, to which is added 6 ounces of
sulphuric acid.</p>

<p>When it becomes necessary to cut zinc
plates, it may be readily done by making a
deep scratch on the surface, filling the
scratch first with dilute sulphuric acid,
and then with mercury. The mercury
will quickly eat into the metal, and the
plate may be easily broken across or cut
with a saw. Zinc plates can be bent into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">190</span>
shape by the application of heat. Hold
the plate in front of a hot fire until it cannot
be touched by the bare hand: it will
be found that it has softened so that it can
be bent around a suitable wooden form.
As zinc plates are most attacked at the
surface of the acid solution, it is advisable
to coat the extreme upper portion of them
with varnish or paraffin. Rolled zinc is
always preferable to cast, especially so
when immersed in acid solutions.</p>

<p>To avoid confusion, it may be stated
here that it is the rule to speak of the zinc
element as the positive plate and the negative
electrode or pole, and the carbon <i>vice
versa</i>. The portion of the element immersed
in the solution is the plate, the part
outside, the pole or electrode. In diagrams
and also in formulæ positive is
shown by a + (plus) sign and negative by
a-(minus) sign.</p>

<p>The relation of cost of the materials most
used is shown in the subjoined table, which
cost, however, varies with the market:</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Gravity Battery.</span></h3>

<p>A cheap modification of the Daniell cell.
A glass jar has at the bottom a copper
plate consisting of 4 to 6 leaves of thin
sheet copper, set on their edges in a starlike
shape, a copper wire being attached
to the copper rivet which holds the leaves
together. A mass of crystals of sulphate
of copper is filled in and laid on the top of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">192</span>
the copper electrode an inch or so above
its top. The negative plate is a variously
shaped plate of cast zinc hung from the
edge of the jar and reaching about 2 inches
from the top into the fluid. Water is
poured in until it covers the zinc, and the
battery is complete. The sulphate of copper
deposits its metallic copper on the
copper leaves and liberates sulphuric acid,
which rises and attacks the zinc, setting
free sulphate of zinc. The sulphate of
zinc solution being of greater density remains
near the bottom, and the sulphate
of zinc solution stays near the zinc. When
the cell is left too long on an open circuit
the two solutions tend to mix, and copper
is deposited on the zinc. The sulphate of
zinc finally saturates the top solution,
which has to be partly drawn off and replaced
by fresh water and crystals of sulphate
of copper dropped into the jar to
take the place of that which has been decomposed.
Electromotive force 1 volt,
current from <sup>3</sup>∕<sub>10</sub> to <sup>5</sup>∕<sub>10</sub> of an ampere. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">193</span>
practical working of this cell will be treated
of later on in these pages.</p>

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 61.</span></div>
</div>

<p>The Gethins (Fig. 61) and the Hussey
bluestone cells both have the zincs standing
in porous cups (shown by dotted lines),
which in turn are supported
half-way down the
jar, generally resting on
the copper strip acting as
a porous partition between
the fluids. The
zinc stands in a solution
of zinc sulphate, or a weak
sulphuric acid solution.
The internal resistance is
low, and the current large,
being from 1 to 5 amperes.
These cells are the
ideal bluestone cells for charging storage
batteries requiring very little attention.
The special Gethins cell shown in the figure
has the copper made with a collar,
which encircles the porous cup, and thereby
lowers the internal resistance of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">194</span>
battery. The voltage not being over 1 volt,
however, renders these cells hardly suitable
for direct connection. Five cells connected
in multiple would give all of 10 amperes of
current, and 1 volt, and a number of these
multiple groups could be connected in series
for a higher voltage.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Gordon Battery</span></h3>

<p>is similar in operation to the Edison-Lalande,
but differs in details of construction. The
zinc is a heavy ring suspended outside, but
not touching a perforated tin cylinder closed
at the bottom, containing the oxide of copper
in flakes. Its internal resistance is slightly
higher than the Edison-Lalande cell, otherwise
there is little choice. The 6 × 8 size
is excellent for coil work, giving 250 actual
ampere hours and remaining on open circuit
for long periods without deterioration.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">195</span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Edison-Lalande Cell.</span></h3>

<p>This is a practical form of the old
Lalande-Chaperon cell, and gives a steady,
large current, being of low internal resistance,
but is of low electromotive force, being
less than .70 volt on closed circuit of medium
resistance. Being of low internal resistance,
however, its output is large—three cells of
the type <i>S</i>; internal resistance, 0.025 ohm.
Capacity, 300 ampere hours, will about equal
one cell type E 5 of the Chloride Storage
Battery. The elements of this cell consist
of positive plates of amalgamated zinc, suspended
on each side of negative plates of
the black oxide of copper in an electrolyte
solution of caustic potash. In action the
decomposition of water forms an oxide of
zinc from the positive element, which with
the potash in combination leaves a soluble
salt of zinc and potash. The hydrogen of
the water acts on the oxide plates to form
metallic copper, thus really reducing, instead
of increasing, the internal resistance of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">196</span>
the cell. A layer of heavy paraffin oil is
poured on top of the solution to prevent the
action of air.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">New Standard</span>,</h3>

<p>or Roche dry cell. This cell possesses
remarkable recuperative powers and low
internal resistance. Made in many sizes, the
best suited for medical coils is No. 2; dimensions,
5<sup>7</sup>∕<sub>8</sub> × 2<sup>7</sup>∕<sub>16</sub> inches. For heavier work
the No. 5, 6 × 2<sup>9</sup>∕<sub>16</sub> inches, and known as
the Navy Standard, is recommended. A
convenient size for portable medical coils is
No. 3, 3¾ × 1⅞ inches, taking up very little
room, yet giving a large output. Two of
these latter cells enclosed in the coil case
will give with a suitably wound primary
(No. 18 to 20 B &amp; S) as strong a current
as can be used in electrotherapy. For
Ruhmkorff coils cells Nos. 6 and 7 (6 × 3
inches and 7 × 3 inches) furnish a most
desirable battery for all work not needing
the constant operation of the contact breaker,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">197</span>
such as wireless telegraphy, gas-lighting,
etc. They will do service on X-ray work,
but the writer prefers a storage cell or the
copper oxide types. The E. M. F. of the
above cells is one and six-tenths volts, and
current from 9 amperes to the No. 7 size,
which gives 24 amperes on short circuit.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Dry-Cell Construction.</span></h3>

<p>As a matter of practice, there is no really
dry cell; all so-called cells contain liquid
held in suspension, and their output is
limited to the amount of fluid. One of this
type can easily be made in the following
manner: A containing jar is made up of
first-quality sheet zinc, the edges being
joined by a turned seam and then soldered,
the bottom of zinc being also soldered in.
In soldering here, as actually in all such
operations, be <i>absolutely sure</i> the edges of
the metal are clean. The jar is partially filled
with the following composition: Oxide of
zinc, 1 part; sal ammoniac, 1 part; plaster<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">198</span>
of paris, 3 parts; chloride of zinc, 1 part;
water, 2 parts, all by weight; or sal ammoniac,
1 part; chloride of calcium, 5 parts;
calcined magnesia, 5 parts; water, 2 parts,
or enough water to make a thin paste. A
brass binding post is soldered to the zinc
case and a carbon plate having a binding
post is inserted in the centre of the cell, care
being taken that it does not touch the zinc.
A small disc of wood laid in the bottom of
the cell will prevent contact at the bottom.
Molten pitch or a composition of pitch and
rosin in the proportion of 6 to 1 is poured
on top, so as to seal the cell. As gas is
generated in the cell, a safety valve should
be provided, either a piece of porous cane
or a short length of hard rubber tube, inside
of which have been placed a few strands of
woollen thread. This class of cell is so
cheap and so many forms are available for
choice that it is rarely desirable to make
one's own. They will not do for steady
current, but only for intermittent work. The
large sizes being of low internal resistance,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">199</span>
can be used for signalling in wireless telegraphy,
where it is not possible to use wet
(or free fluid) cells. The principal dry cells
on the market are the Mesco, the O. K., the
Nungesser, and the Samson semi-dry cell.</p>

<small>STORAGE OR SECONDARY CELL.</small></h2>
</div>

<p>The development of the storage or secondary
cell has been one of the most important
electrical advances of the century.
For purposes of experiment or work, where
a large or steady current is required from
compact and readily tended apparatus,
the storage cell proves its utility. The
simplest form was that used by the early
experimenters, and as it is easy to make,
a form of it may very well be described.</p>


<div class="figcenter" ><a id="fig62"></a>
<img src="images/i_201.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap gap10">Fig. 62.</span> <span class="smcap">Fig. 63.</span></div>
</div>

<p>From a sheet of lead ⅛ inch thick two or
more pieces are cut of the requisite size,
say, 5 inches square. In making these
plates, they should be cut so as to leave a
strip 1 inch wide and 3 inches long, projecting
from one corner, <i>A</i> (Fig. 62), for
the purpose of connection. This is for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">201</span>
the reason that the fumes of the sulphuric
acid solution would quickly corrode any
wires or screws in the plates, and also to
give a better connection. The number of
plates cut must be an odd one, as it is
general to make the two outside plates of
the same polarity—viz., negative. These
plates are then scored with a steel point
across and across on both sides to perhaps
a depth of <sup>1</sup>∕<sub>64</sub> of an inch. This scoring is
not absolutely necessary; it somewhat
hastens the formation of the plates. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">202</span>
plates are then laid face to face, being
separated by pieces of wood, rubber, or,
still better, by a piece of grooved wood,
Fig. 63 having a thin piece of asbestos on
each side. These grooves are to carry off
the gas, and should run up and down the
board, as in the figure. The wood is ⅛ of
an inch thick or thereabouts, and preferably
perforated with holes ¼ of an inch or
larger. When laid together, a few strong
rubber bands hold the plates from coming
apart. To prevent lateral motion, a few
rubber pins may be thrust through the
plates. The alternate strips are to be connected
together in two series, as in a condenser,
and the complete series placed in
a jar containing a mixture of seven parts
of water to one of sulphuric acid. The
terminal of the strips connected to the
smallest number of plates is to be marked
<i>P</i> or +, for positive.</p>

<p>This terminal is now to be connected to
a charging current (not over 1 ampere), as
described in the directions for charging<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">203</span>
batteries, for eight hours, and then discharged
at a rate not over 1 ampere for
six hours. Then the connections are to
be reversed and the cell charged backward,
as it were, and discharged. This
has to be repeated for a long period, perhaps
a month, before the cell is in good
condition; on the final charge it is to be
connected positive to positive of charging
source. This operation is called "forming,"
and the result is to change the metallic
lead of the positive plate into red-brown
peroxide of lead, and the lead negative
plates into spongy lead.</p>

<p>In modern commercial cells this operation
is no longer pursued, the plates are
variously constructed of lead frameworks
holding plugs of litharge or lead oxide,
which is "formed" with great facility.
For many purposes other than operating
Ruhmkorff coils, a few simple cells made,
as described, are handy to have and easy
to make. In sealing the cells up for portability,
care must always be taken to leave<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">204</span>
a small hole in the cover for the escape of
the sulphurous acid gas.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Charging Storage Batteries.</span></h3>

<p>Although the charging of a storage or
secondary battery is by no means a difficult
operation, yet it requires care, and
one unaccustomed to the work will meet
many slight difficulties which may seriously
affect the results. Pre-eminently the
best charging source is a direct current,
constant potential electric-light circuit.
The amount of current required varies according
to the type and make of the cell,
but we will select one of a capacity of 50
ampere hours for illustration.</p>

<p>By 50 ampere hours is meant a delivery
of 1 ampere per hour for fifty hours, or a
rate of discharge equal to the above, as
2 amperes per hour for twenty-five hours.
In practice a secondary cell will not be
found to act exactly as above, the total
amount of current decreasing as the discharge
is greater. Each cell is constructed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">205</span>
to discharge at a certain rate, above which
it is not safe to go. Five amperes per
hour is a suitable rate for a fifty-hour cell,
and should not be greatly exceeded. The
Chloride type, however, is one which can
be discharged at a higher rate than normal
without any serious results, the latter
being generally a bulging or "buckling,"
as it is called, of the plates whereby they
short circuit or fall apart. The voltage of
the charging source should be at least 10
per cent over that of the battery when
fully charged. The voltage of a cell of
storage battery varies from about 2.3 at
commencement of discharge to 1.7, at
which latter voltage discharge must be
stopped and charging recommenced.</p>

<p>Fig. 64 shows the connections to charge
a storage battery from an electric-light circuit.
The latter must be direct current
and of low tension. The circuit from the
negative lead runs to the rheostat handle
<i>R</i>, thence through as many coils as are in
circuit (varied by moving the handle over<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">206</span>
the contact pieces in connection with the
resistance coils). The positive of the cell is
connected to the positive main.</p>

<p>In connecting storage cells to the mains
the utmost care must be taken that the terminals
are correctly attached. It happens in
isolated plants that some change is made in
the wiring or the switchboard, which reverses
the current without warning being
given to the battery charger. It is the
safest way to test the polarity of the terminals
of <i>both</i> battery and mains each time
charging is commenced. For polarity tests
see Chapter I. It is immaterial on which
side of the battery the rheostat or similar
device is placed.</p>

</div>

<p>Fig. 65 shows the employment of lamps
instead of the rheostat. The lamps <i>L L</i>
regulate the current flow by the manner
in which the circuit is arranged. If only
one lamp be turned on, the current necessary
for only one lamp circulates through<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">207</span>
the battery. Each additional lighted lamp<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">208</span>
adds to the current by decreasing the resistance
of the circuit. <i>S</i> is a switch which
must always be left open when the dynamos
are to be stopped.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Charging from Primary Battery.</span></h3>

<p>In many instances an electric-light circuit
is not available for charging purposes,
in which event recourse must be made to
a primary battery. The one most suited
for the work is the modified Daniell, or
copper and zinc combination in solutions
of sulphate of copper (bluestone) and sulphate
of zinc respectively.</p>

<p>There are many good forms of this cell
on the market, chief of which are the simple
gravity, the Gethins, and the Hussey,
which have been previously described.
An example will now be described of the
operations necessary with the gravity cell,
charging one 50-ampere hour storage cell.
At least six cells of gravity will be required,
as the voltage of each cell is never<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">209</span>
over 1 volt, and is dependent on the resistance
in the external circuit falling as the
resistance is lowered. Place the six clean
glass jars on a firm foundation, where there
is no liability of shaking and no dust likely
to settle. Unfold the copper strips into
the form of a star, bending the corners for
half an inch so as to give an anchorage in
the bluestone. Place them into the bottom
of the jars and pour in water enough
to cover them at least 3 inches below the
surface. Now carefully drop in 4 pounds
of clean bluestone, which will fill in the
angles between the copper wings, at the
same time holding the element down to
the bottom of the jar. Hang the zincs
from the top edge of the jar, and fill up
with water to 1 inch from the top. The
addition of 5 ounces of sulphate of zinc
per cell will render the cells immediately
available, and for the further hastening of
the chemical action, the copper wire from
each copper may be inserted in the binding
post-hole of the zinc belonging to its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">210</span>
own cell and screwed tight for a few
hours; or the cells may be connected together
in series, and the wire from the last
copper be screwed to the zinc of the first,
thus putting the whole series on short circuit.
The only advantage of the first
method being a saving of time when a
number of cells is being set up. This saving
of time is often of consequence, as the
longer the newly set-up cell is on open
circuit, the more copper will be deposited
on the zinc, which is highly undesirable.
This is shown by the blackening of the
zinc as soon as it is put in the solution,
which blackening it is hard to prevent entirely.
When the cell is working satisfactorily
it will show a clearly defined line
between the colorless solution above and
the deep blue solution beneath.</p>

<p>Gravity cells should never be moved.
If no sulphate of zinc is available, half a
teaspoonful of sulphuric acid may be
poured in over the zinc, which will tend
to form the sulphate of zinc. Without<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">211</span>
any of these helps the cell will take at
least twenty-four hours on a short circuit
before it will give its normal current. This
current should be from <sup>4</sup>∕<sub>10</sub> to <sup>5</sup>∕<sub>10</sub> of an
ampere. Five cells set up by the writer
varied after the addition of the
zinc sulphate from 200 milli-amperes
(thousandths of an ampere)
to 300 milli-amperes, although
they were apparently
all set up alike; but after twelve
hours' short circuiting they all
gave a fairly uniform current of
from 470 to 500 milli-amperes.</p>

<div class="figright" ><a id="fig66"></a>
<img src="images/i_211.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 66.</span></div>
</div>
<p>From time to time on storage
battery work, say, every week,
the specific gravity of the top
solution must be tested with a
hydrometer (see Fig. 66), which
should be put into the solution and allowed
to come to rest. The indicated number at
the level of the liquid should be 25°. If
the number is higher some solution should
be drawn off and clear water added, until<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">212</span>
the hydrometer settles down to 25° or
thereabouts. The inside of the glass jar
for 1 inch from the top may be greased to
prevent the salts of zinc creeping over the
edge, or half an inch of heavy paraffin oil
be poured on the top to prevent evaporation
and creeping. When the zinc gets
very much coated with the dark deposit it
must be taken out and scraped and washed.
When the bluestone needs replenishing,
drop in carefully and be sure none lodges
on the zinc element.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Setting up the Storage Cell.</span></h3>

<p>Each manufacturer of storage cells issues
specific directions for the charging of his
own make, but generally the method is as
follows: The acid solution is prepared by
mixing one volume of sulphuric acid to
from four to seven volumes of water, according
to the make of the cell. The sulphuric
acid should have a specific gravity
of 1.82 and be chemically pure. <i>The acid
must always be poured into the water, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">213</span>
slowly, stirring all the time, then set aside
for the mixture to cool.</i> It is best to mix
the solution in a separate earthenware vessel,
and when two or more cells are to be
set up, to mix all the solution at one time,
to ensure the same strength, unless a
hydrometer is used to determine this.</p>

<p>A good method to ascertain the exact
quantity of solution required is to place
the elements in the jar and cover 1 inch
deep at least with water, then remove the
elements and pour off the volume of water
corresponding to the proportion of acid
to be added, and lastly pouring the remaining
water into the mixing vessel, prepare
the solution, or electrolyte, as it is called.
New elements should be wetted with pure
water before being immersed in the solution.
An ordinary charge of the electrolyte
requires from six to ten hours to cool
thoroughly, as considerable heat is evolved
in the mixing.</p>

<p>Having now prepared the storage battery
solution and set up the primary cells,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">214</span>
the charging can be proceeded with. The
current must be turned on the storage cell
immediately the elements are placed in
the acid. Connect the wire from the zinc
of the primary battery to the negative of
the storage cell and the copper wire to
the positive. As the current from a gravity
cell is but small, it will take quite a
time to charge a storage cell of 50 ampere
hours' capacity fully; it is a good scheme
to get the cell charged up from a dynamo
source, and use the gravity cells to keep
it charged; but this cannot always be
done, and the gravity battery will do the
work in time. As the best storage cells
render but 90 per cent of the current put
into them, they must be charged over the
number of hours for which they are required
to deliver current.</p>

<p>When the cell is fully charged the solution
will become milky and give off gas
freely. This gas in large quantities is detrimental
to health, and on no account
should a storage cell be <i>charged</i> in a sleep<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">215</span>ing
apartment. It affects the throat and
lungs, and renders them susceptible to
take cold under suitable circumstances.
The average voltage of storage cells, when
tested with the charging current on, is 2.4
volts, and the lowest they should be allowed
to reach is 1.9 volts, unless otherwise
specified by the manufacturers.</p>

<p>Cells in poor condition are liable to form
a <i>white</i> deposit of sulphate of lead, this
fault being known as "sulphating." This
trouble requires much careful nursing,
and the cells must be charged for a long
time at a very low rate until the plates of
the positive element regain their normal
gray color. Chips of straw or excelsior,
etc., falling in between the plates will carbonize
and cause trouble.</p>

<p>Most portable cells are sealed, but all
cells can be easily sealed with paraffin wax
for amateur use. Cover the elements fully
½ inch above the normal height of the electrolyte
with water before pouring in the
electrolyte. Melt some paraffin in an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">216</span>
earthenware jar and pour it on top of the
water, about the middle of the surface,
when it will spread, and care having been
taken to have the jar sides dry, will cake
solid and form a good seal. Then bore a
hole with a brace and bit or some such
tool through the wax and pour out the
water. The cell can then be set up as
usual, the hole being only partly closed to
allow of the escape of the generated gas.
A glass or rubber tube can be sealed into
the hole in the wax, and makes a more
finished job.</p>

<p>While on the subject of primary batteries
for charging storage cells, a few remarks
on their electromotive force may
not be amiss. Although the specifications
issued by the manufacturers specify an excess
charging voltage of 10 per cent over
the total voltage of the storage cells, this
does not apply to primary cells in its entirety.
The voltage of five gravity cells
in series would aggregate 5 volts, and the
voltage of one storage cell but 2 volts, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">217</span>
there would not be 5 volts available to force
the charging current through the latter. In
the first place there is the counter electromotive
force of the storage cell working
against the gravity battery. Simple subtraction
would show only 3 volts excess in
favor of the primary electromotive force;
but the working voltage of a galvanic cell
varies according to external resistance of
the cell and the external resistance of the
circuit. When the internal resistance is
high, as in the gravity cell, and the circuit
resistance is low, in this case being the
storage cell, the available electromotive
force of the primary is low also.</p>

<p>In many cases it is desired to operate a
Ruhmkorff coil from an electric-light main
direct. This can readily be done if the circuit
be of the constant potential class—that
is, one constructed to furnish current
for incandescent lamps in multiple. With
the direct current, such as the Edison, all
that is necessary is either to interpose a
rheostat, as in Fig. 64, or to use the lamps,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">218</span>
as in Fig. 65. The manner of connecting
up is the same as if the storage cell B be
replaced by the coil. Using the formula
<i>C</i> = <i>E</i>/<i>R</i>, for example, if the circuit be at
110 volts and the coil require 10 amperes,
a resistance of 11 ohms will be required.
Or using the lamps in the diagram, Fig.
65, about 20 lamps are to be put in circuit.
If the current be an alternating one,
the contact-breaker will have to be screwed
down or short circuited.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The "U. S." Storage Cell.</span></h3>

<p>This cell is of the lead-zinc type, being
the practical form of the Reynier cell. It
is to be recommended for working Ruhmkorff
coils, its output weight for weight
being far in excess of the lead-lead types.
This cell is readily portable and easy of
operation, the zinc electrode being the only
one needing renewal, and that at very infrequent
intervals.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">219</span></p>

<p>The lead electrode consists of plates of
peroxide clamped together, and presents
quite a large surface. The zinc in most
types is of the circular sheet form, and
encloses the lead block, being kept amalgamated
by mercury lying in the bottom of
the cell. The E. M. F. on open circuit is
about 2.5 volts, which is higher than any
lead-lead combination. On closed-circuit
work this drops to from 2.35 volts downwards.
During action, when a large amount
of current is being drawn from the cell, a
white sulphate appears, but this disappears
upon the cell being recharged or even left
to rest. Bubbles of gas, which sometimes
form under the peroxide block, should be
removed by gently tilting the cell or hitting
the table or shelf upon which it stands a
smart blow. The large type No. 3 is suitable
for X-ray work, and a still larger cell is
made, which is preferable for heavy or
continuous discharges of current.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">220</span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Harrison Cell.</span></h3>

<p>The No. 1 cell recently put upon the
market has given excellent results for open
circuit work. It consists of a negative element
with lead peroxide as a depolarizer.
The positive element is self-amalgamating
zinc, which is free from local action. The
electrolyte is dilute pure sulphuric acid.
The potential is high, being 2.5 volts, and
the internal resistance is 0.14 ohm. This
cell belongs to a group which is midway
between primary and storage, or secondary
cells. Its construction is similar to the lead-zinc
secondary cell, in place of which it may
be used, it being easy to recharge an exhausted
cell by passing a weak current
through it in reverse direction, thus recharging
the peroxide of lead grid and renewing
the zinc and electrolyte.</p>

<p>The large size, or type No. 3, which the
manufacturers are producing, differs from
the No. 1 cell in that it has a larger negative<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">221</span>
element, or grid, and has two zincs, instead
of one; consequently, it has a lower internal
resistance—0.07 ohm—and a higher discharge
rate with a capacity of 150 ampere
hours. The potential is 2.5 volts. It is
suitable for coil work or for sparking gas
engines, and for ease of manipulation and
convenience is to be highly recommended.</p>

<div class="figcenter" ><a id="fig67"></a>
<img src="images/i_221.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 67.</span></div>
</div>

<p>The elements are shown in Fig. 67, lead
grid <i>L</i>, which is filled in with paste of
peroxide of lead, and which neither buckles
nor disintegrates. The zinc <i>Z</i>, however,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">222</span>
possesses a novel feature. A cavity is cast
in the zinc element and filled with an amalgam
of mercury, the copper electrode passing
through this amalgam into the solid zinc, as
shown in the cut. As the action of the
battery proceeds, this amalgam forces its
way into the pores of the element and keeps
up so good an amalgamation of both copper
rod and zinc that zincs can be used up to
a point when the rising internal resistance
makes it economy to throw them away, and
absolutely no perceptible local action takes
place in the cell upon continued open circuit.
A preparation is furnished if desired, which
forms a jelly of the electrolyte, making the
cell readily portable. Like all of these combinations,
its electromotive force exceeds
two volts, and its internal resistance is low
enough to advise its employment in coil
work.</p>

<p>When a storage battery is to remain unused
for a long time it must first be fully
charged, and then every week or so the charging
current passed through it until it bubbles.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">223</span>
Where it is to be laid away for a long period
of time, and weekly charging is not feasible,
the following operations are necessary:
First, fully charge battery, remove electrolyte,
and replace by water immediately.
Discharge at normal rate until voltage runs
down to 1.7 per cell. Gradually decrease
resistance until battery is almost on short
circuit. Let it stand for a day, then pour
off the water, and keep elements in a dry,
clean place.</p>

<small>TESLA AND HERTZ EFFECTS.</small></h2>
</div>

<p>The currents of high frequency used by
Tesla in his researches are produced by
electrical rather than mechanical means.
The alternating current dynamo used by
him renders a current of 10,000 alternations
per second, but the actual current
necessary to the performance of the luminous
effects has a frequency of millions of
oscillations per second, produced by the
discharge of Leyden jars or condensers.</p>

<p>Dr. Oliver J. Lodge, in his "Modern
Views of Electricity," shows that the discharge
of the Leyden jar is in general oscillatory,
the apparently single and momentary
spark, when analyzed in a very rapidly
rotating mirror, is shown to consist of a
series of alternating flashes, rapidly suc<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">225</span>ceeding
one another and lasting individually
less than one hundred thousandth of
a second. The capacity of the condenser
and inertia of the circuit regulate the
rapidity of these oscillations. A 1 microfarad
condenser discharging through a
coil of large self-induction, such as one
having an iron core, may oscillate only a
few hundred times per second. On the
other hand, a Leyden jar of the 1 pint size
discharging through a short circuit will
set up oscillations, perhaps ten million per
second; and a still smaller jar would give
oscillations away up in the billions. But
these small jars are quickly discharged,
and require a constant replenishing.</p>

<p>The discharge actually consists of a principal
discharge in one direction, and then
several reflex actions back and forth, becoming
feebler until their cessation. In
their vibration they generate waves in the
surrounding medium, similar in many respects
to sound waves, but of infinitely
higher velocity. Their length depends on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">226</span>
the rate of vibration of the source and
their velocity. The microfarad discharge
before mentioned will have a wave length
of perhaps 1200 miles, the small jar not
over 70 feet; and yet the true light wave
has only an average length of one fifty
thousandth of 1 inch. These waves travel
into space until they either die out from
exhaustion or are absorbed by some suitable
body; but they possess the quality of
resonance in a degree like those of sound.
Two tuning forks of the same pitch will
influence one another—that is, one on
being vibrated will start the other in vibration,
even at a considerable distance, but
the electric waves far surpass them in this
respect.</p>

<p>Dr. Hertz made the first practical experiments
in this direction with his electric
resonator (Fig. 68). This apparatus
consisted of a 3-inch spark induction coil,
<i>I</i>, the secondary wires <i>S S</i> being connected
to the copper rods <i>R R</i>, provided with
metal balls <i>B B</i>, nearly 11 inches in diam<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">227</span>eter.
The discharging balls <i>D D</i> were approximated
until a satisfactory discharge
passed between them. A large wire ring
having a spark gap in its circuit was so
influenced by the resonance as to show
minute sparks passing across this gap even
when the ring was situated in a distant
room. In many experiments with a rapidly
vibrating induction coil current, a
sparking has been noticed in metallic objects
in the same room, in one instance it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">228</span>
being discovered in the metallic designs
on a wall-paper.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The "Tesla" Effects.</span></h3>

<p>In exploring the comparatively new field
opened up by Professor Crookes, Nikola
Tesla has stimulated research into the mysteries
of high tension and frequency currents
and their effects. In the majority of
his experiments Tesla uses alternating currents
generated by machinery of his own
design, but in a large number of cases his
effects can be duplicated with an induction
coil suitably energized. In the latter case
the apparatus consists of a battery, a
Ruhmkorff coil, two condensers, and a
second specially constructed induction or
disruptive coil, with some few subsidiary
implements. The contact-breaker or rheotome
must be one giving interruptions of
very rapid sequence.</p>

<div class="figcenter" ><a id="fig69"></a>
<img src="images/i_229.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 69.</span></div>
</div>

<p>Fig. 69 shows a diagram of the Tesla
arrangement with a Ruhmkorff coil. The
terminals of the secondary coil of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">229</span>
Ruhmkorff coil <i>I</i> terminate at the condensers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">230</span>
<i>C C</i>. Bridged across the wires
before they reach the condensers is the
discharger <i>D</i>. The second terminals of
the condensers are led through the split
primary of the disruptive coil, terminating
at the points <i>B B</i> of the second discharger.
The secondary of the disruptive coil is
either outside or inside the primary coil.
The condensers are of special design, being
small, but of high insulation. They each
consist of two plates of metal a few inches
square immersed in oil and arranged so
they can be brought nearer together or
further apart, as necessary. Within limits,
the smaller these plates are the more
frequent will be the oscillations of their
discharge. They also fulfil another purpose,
they help nullify the high self-induction
of the secondary coil by adding capacity
to it.</p>

<div class="figcenter" ><a id="fig70"></a>
<img src="images/i_231.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"> <span class="smcap">Fig. 70.</span></div>
</div>

<p>The discharger tips are preferably metal
balls under 1 inch in diameter. Tesla uses
various forms of dischargers, but for ex<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">231</span>perimental
purposes the two metal balls
will answer. They are adjusted when the
whole apparatus is working according to
the results desired. The mica plates serve
to establish an air current up through the
gap, making the discharge more abrupt, an
air blast being also used at times for the
furtherance of this object. The device
(Fig. 70) consists of an electro-magnet, <i>C</i>,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">232</span>
set with its poles <i>P</i> across the air gap,
helping to wipe out the spark, as in a well-known
form of lightning arrester. This
form, described by Tesla, has the pole
pieces <i>P</i> shielded by mica plates <i>M</i>, to prevent
the sparks jumping into the magnets.
Fig. 70 is an elevation and Fig. 71 a plan
of this device.</p>

</div>

<p>The resonance effects obtained during<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">233</span>
the operation of a Tesla coil are very
marked, and their study may lead to the
solution of the problems of communication
between distant points without the use of
other conducting media than the atmosphere.
But the main use to which the
Tesla currents have been put is that of artificial
illumination. These currents have
enabled experimenters to obtain a high
luminosity in vacua by the aid of only one
conducting wire—in fact, in some cases
without the utilization of any conductor
than the air. An ordinary incandescent
lamp connected to one terminal of the coil
will show in a fair degree some of the luminescent
phenomena. The brush effects
from the terminals of the secondary coil
are extremely marked and interesting;
but to detail the experiments that can be
performed with the Tesla disruptive coil
would be an impossibility here. Reference
is recommended to the published
works of Nikola Tesla, which happily are
readily procurable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">234</span></p>

<p>These currents of high frequency have
of late been turned to account in electrotherapeutics,
principally for the stimulation
they exert on the nutritive process.
They also exert a very great influence on
the vasomotor centres, as is evidenced by
the reddening of the skin and exudation
of perspiration. This result is readily obtainable
by placing the patient in connection
with one electrode on an insulating
stool, and terminating the other electrode
at a large metal plate situated a few feet
distant; or the patient may be surrounded
by a coil of wire in connection with the
coil of sufficient diameter, however, to
prevent contact.</p>

<small>THE "ROENTGEN" RAYS AND RADIOGRAPHY.</small></h2>
</div>

<p>Although the remarkable discovery
that it was possible by electrical means to
depict an image of an object on a photographic
sensitized plate, despite the intervention
of solid bodies, was first given to
the world at large by Professor Roentgen,
yet he was undoubtedly led to the results
by consideration of the works of previous
experimenters in electrical discharges
through vacua.</p>

<p>It is not intended here to trace the previous
work of Professor Crookes, the inventor
of the radiometer, which is actuated
by the heat rays of light, nor of
Hertz, who found that gold leaf was transparent
to rays emanating from certain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">236</span>
vacuum tubes carrying a luminous electrical
discharge. It is mainly the purpose of
these pages to give directions for practical
work, and not deal in theories, interesting
though they be. At the beginning of X-ray
investigation many claims were made which
have since been disproven, but the fundamental
operations remain the same. A
Crookes tube of special design is energized
from a coil or similar electrical distributor,
and by means of the resultant rays otherwise
opaque objects appear partially transparent,
their shadows being cast upon the
screen of a fluoroscope, or these shadows
are allowed to act upon a sensitized photographic
plate, and subsequent development
reveals outlines or shadowgraphs. The
general arrangement of apparatus is shown
in Fig. 72. <i>C</i> is a Ruhmkorff coil, giving
not less than 2 inches of spark; <i>B</i> the battery
operating same; <i>T</i> the modified form of
Crookes tube used most generally; <i>X</i> the
object under observation; <i>F</i> the fluoroscope
or the sensitized photographic plate. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">238</span>
usual precautions are taken to avoid the
leakage of current from the secondary wires,
the tube <i>T</i> being best mounted in a wooden
stand (Fig. 72), and the wire connections
brought to it as direct as possible. No
condenser, stand, etc., are shown in drawing,
to avoid unnecessary complication.</p>

<div class="figcenter" ><a id="fig72"></a>
<img src="images/i_237.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 72.</span></div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">237</span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Fluoroscope.</span></h3>

<p>This is a funnel-shaped cardboard box
with an opening at the smaller end for the
eyes and a piece of card across the larger
end. The inside surface of this card is
covered with crystals of barium platino
cyanide, the most satisfactory fluorescent
substance obtainable. The earlier fluoroscopes
were made with tungstate of calcium,
but the above salt has proven far more
satisfactory. The operation of the fluoroscope
is simple. It is held in the hand by a
convenient handle, the open end pressed
close to the eyes, so as to exclude outside<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">239</span>
light, and with the hand or other object held
against the outside of the big end, or screen,
it is directed towards the Crookes tube.
The screen then appears to glow with a
bluish light, and the shadow of the object
is distinctly seen on the screen. Different
adjustments of the coil give results which
will be treated upon later.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Phosphorus Tube.</span></h3>

<p>Messrs. Siemens and Halske manufactured
a tube which allowed of a slight
variation of vacuum by using the vapor of
phosphorus. An auxiliary tube containing
phosphorus was added to the main tube, and
upon heat being applied to it by means of
a lamp, vapor is given off, which materially
reduces the vacuum of the main tube. When
the opposite result is desired part of the
current is diverted through the auxiliary
tube, and the vapor is caused to solidify itself
upon the walls of the tube.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">240</span></p>

<div class="figcenter" ><a id="fig73"></a>
<img src="images/i_240.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 73.</span></div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">241</span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Crookes Tube.</span></h3>

<p>The most satisfactory tube for X-ray
work is one where the vacuum is readily
adjustable. Reference to Fig. 73 shows the
Queen form. A small bulb, containing a
chemical which gives off vapor when heated
and reabsorbs it when cooled, is directly
connected to the main tube and surrounded
by an auxiliary tube, which is exhausted to
a low vacuum. In the auxiliary tube the
cathode is opposite to the above-mentioned
bulb, so that any discharge through it will
heat the bulb by the bombardment of the
cathode rays. The cathode is connected to
a spark point, which can be adjusted to any
distance from the cathode of the main tube.
The anode of the small tube is directly connected
to that of the main tube. When the
tube is put into operation the vacuum and,
consequently, the resistance of the main tube
being high, the current preferably passes
by the spark point and auxiliary tube, heat<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">242</span>ing
the chemical for a few seconds until
sufficient vapor has been driven into the
main tube to permit the current to pass
through the latter. After this only an occasional
spark will jump across the gap to
counteract the tendency of the reabsorption
of the vapor and consequent raising in
resistance of the main tube.</p>

<p>This device presents easy means of adjusting
the vacuum in the main tube. With the
spark point at a considerable distance from
cathode the vacuum will be high. When the
spark gap is short the vacuum will become
low. The main bulb is about 4½ inches in
diameter, and at the place where the X-rays
pass only <sup>1</sup>∕<sub>64</sub> of an inch in thickness. The
cathode is of aluminum, the anode of platinum.
In starting this tube, it is best to
make the spark gap about one inch in width.
When connected up and working properly
the main bulb will be filled with a green
striated luminosity between anode and
cathode, and the tip of the chemical bulb
will have the shadow of the little platinum<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">243</span>
tip thrown upon it. The green light is not
always brilliant; at times it is quite weak,
but yet does its work well. A brilliant green
light is often one of the signs of wrong
connection, and particularly so when the
little shadow on the chemical bulb is absent.
Never run these or any other tubes backwards,
but be sure the current is flowing
in correct direction at first operation.</p>

<p>Other forms of Crookes tubes differ only
in form, or are devoid of adjustment, and
the connections of coil, tube, etc., are the
same.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">General Remarks.</span></h3>

<p>A high vacuum gives greater penetrative
power than a low vacuum. Where the
operator has not an adjustable tube it is
imperative that he have at least two tubes,
one high and one low. It is the contrasts
which render the X-ray practical, and these
contrasts are largely governed by the
vacuum. In locating a metallic substance
in the human body a high vacuum tube<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">244</span>
would be needed, that the bones and dense
tissue be rendered more transparent. On
the other hand, to make a radiograph of the
bones, a lower vacuum is necessary in order
to get a contrast between the bones and the
tissues. In general, a high vacuum is best
for fluoroscope work and a low vacuum for
making pictures on a photographic plate.
Short exposures in radiography are obtained
by powerful rays and consequently by coils
operating at considerable energy. In extended
examinations or where a subject is
under the X-rays for more than a minute
or so, a screen should be interposed between
the subject and the tube to avoid the burning
effect which is often noticeable. This screen
consists of a piece of cardboard well covered
with gold leaf, and should be grounded—that
is, a connection be run from the gold
surface to a water-pipe or other ground
connection. Sheet lead is an efficient screen
to the rays, and, if desired, a lead screen can
be made, partially enclosing the apparatus,
to protect the operator. But it must be large<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">245</span>
enough and far enough distant from the
coil and tube to avoid any possibility of
leakage of current or even inductive influence.
In operating X-ray machines never
attempt to alter connections or make adjustments
other than at coil platinum screw or
Crookes tube spark gap without first shutting
off current. Remember that a very
unpleasant shock can be easily obtained from
touching the apparatus with only one hand.
It is often advisable to remove one's watch,
particularly when using Ruhmkorff coils of
large size.</p>

<p>The tube may be worked until it shows
a slight redness in the centre of the platinum,
but care must then be taken not to increase
current, or the platinum will melt. Never
allow the tube to come in contact with any
object other than its stand and connections
while working, and be sure the wires from
secondary do not come near tube until they
reach places of attachment, or they may
spark through glass and ruin the tube.</p>

<p>In making radiographs on sensitized<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">246</span>
plates the unused plates should be kept at
a considerable distance from the coil while
working. Better still if they are in another
room. Plates for X-ray work are made by
most photographic supply dealers; in fact,
almost any good brand of sensitized plates
or even films will answer. When making
a radiograph, the plate can either be left in
the holder or well wrapped in black paper,
but current should never be turned on coil
before the plate and subject are in position.
In photographing the chest, neck, etc., the
plate can be strapped on to the part; but the
subject must remain absolutely still. The
time of exposure varies considerably with the
size of coil, thickness of object, etc. Radiographs
of the hand have been taken by
simply laying the hand on top of the plateholder
and operating tube for 100 seconds.
But, as a rule, longer exposures are necessary.
Most radiographs will generally
require that the plate be "intensified" and
a developer used that gives great detail, such
as metol quinol, etc. At any rate, great care<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">247</span>
should be exercised in developing the plate,
as many a good radiograph has been spoiled
by undue haste.</p>

<small>WIRELESS TELEGRAPHY.</small></h2>
</div>

<p>In Chapter XII. we showed how Dr.
Hertz caused electric waves to pass through
space and become visible by sparks across
an air gap in a wire ring situated at a distance
from the source of energy. The
apparatus used, and termed an electric
resonator, is in principle similar to that of
the wireless telegraph. The minute sparks
instead of idly passing across the air gap
are made to traverse a "coherer" (to be
afterwards more fully described). This
"coherer" substantially consists of a resistance,
preferably metal filings placed in series,
with a battery and relay. Normally, the
resistance is so adjusted that the battery
current is not strong enough to operate the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">249</span>
relay. A wire is led from one side of this
coherer up into the air to intercept the
Hertzian waves, the other side of the coherer
is put to earth, or "grounded." When a
wave strikes the air wire it sends a current
through the coherer to ground (as before it
sent a spark across the air gap), and this
wave acts on the filings in its passage
through them; in effect, to lower their resistance,
so that the current is increased through
the relay circuit and the relay armature is
attracted to its magnet. The relay makes
contact in the usual manner at the platinum
points, and in its turn causes the local
circuit, sounder, bell, or pen register to
record the wave (or signal). After each
wave the filings are in such state that to
restore them to their former high resistance
it is necessary to give the coherer a smart
tap. This is generally accomplished automatically
by means of an arm extending
from the sounder lever, which strikes against
the coherer each time the sounder armature
is moved.</p>

<p>Figures 74 and 75 are diagrams of a
simple circuit, Fig. 74 being the transmitting
apparatus and Fig. 75 the receiving apparatus.</p>

<p>In Fig. 74 <i>P P</i> and <i>S S</i> are the primary
and secondary of a Ruhmkorff coil, <i>D</i> two
brass balls on the discharger, <i>B</i> the battery,
<i>K</i> a key, in place of the usual contact
breaker, which is either absent or screwed
down; <i>V</i> a wire leading from one arm of
the discharger up into the air, of a height
varying with the results desired; <i>G</i> a ground
plate in connection with the other discharger
arm.</p>

<p>The coil condenser is left out of the diagram
for sake of clearness; but, of course,
is necessary to the operation of the apparatus.</p>

<p>In Fig. 75, <i>C</i> is the coherer, also called
the Branly tube, or radio conductor; <i>S</i>
a telegraph sounder, or electric bell; <i>R</i> a
relay; <i>R B</i> and <i>L B</i> the relay battery and
local battery, respectively; <i>G</i> a ground connection;
<i>M</i> a resistance, or choke coil, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">252</span>
<i>V</i> a vertical wire, as in the transmitter; in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">253</span>

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 75.</span></div>

<p>The coil to be used may be from two
inches of spark upwards, dependent upon
the distance the signals have to travel. The
relay battery may be two cells of dry battery,
the local battery as much as is desired to
operate the bell, sounder, or pen register
receiving the signals. Presuming the apparatus
set up and adjusted, and designating
the transmitter as Station A and the receiver
as Station B, the operation will be as follows:
A pressure and release of key <i>K</i> sends
an impulse of current through the primary
<i>P</i>, inducing a current in <i>S</i>, which manifests
itself by a spark between the discharger balls
at <i>D</i>. An electric wave is released, which,
starting from <i>V</i>, Station A, meets in its
passage <i>V</i> of Station B. Travelling along
this wire to the ground, it finds two paths—through
<i>C</i> or <i>R</i>. As the choke coil deters it
from passing through the relay, it finds
passage through <i>C</i> and so to ground.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">254</span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Coherer.</span></h3>

<p>Many forms of this apparatus are in use,
but as yet no definite design can be recommended
for specific purposes. The most
general mode of construction is that of the
Branley Coherer, as shown in Fig. 76.</p>

<div class="figcenter" ><a id="fig76"></a>
<img src="images/i_254.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 76.</span></div>
</div>

<p>It consists of a glass tube, 2 inches long
by ¼ inch inside diameter, furnished with
well-fitted metal plugs at each end, to which
connections are made. These plugs can be
slid in and out of tube for adjustment, the
gap between them being loosely filled with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">255</span>
fine metal filings. The metal used varies,
according to the operator's preference, the
most generally adopted being pure nickel
for both plugs and filings. Another mode
of construction for purely experimental use
is to merely cork the ends of the tube and
pass the wires through these corks into the
filings, ensuring, however, good contact
between wires and filings. Marconi's favorite
form is a glass tube two inches long with
silver plugs, each one-quarter inch long, in
each end, intervening space being partially
filled with a mixture of nickel and silver
filings. These plugs are then adjusted to
as close as one-twenty-fifth of an inch, and
the whole apparatus exhausted of air either
by means of a leading-in tube or by placing
coherer in a vessel from which the air can
be drawn. As a rule, coherers containing
air become less sensitive after continued
use.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">256</span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Carbon Coherer.</span></h3>

<p>Pointed carbon rods can be inserted in
the tube instead of metal, and carbon dust
substituted for the metal filings; but this
form is suitable only for special purposes.
It is very delicate in its action, but somewhat
uncertain.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Coherer without Filings.</span></h3>

<p>Were it not for reasons, such as difficulty
of decoherence, the metal filings might be
dispensed with and two rods of metal placed
in light contact. The construction of the
coherer reminds one very much of the microphone,
a satisfactory coherer having been
made out of the old "nail microphone," four
wire nails being placed crossing one another
in the battery circuit, in one case acting as
a sound transmitter, whence the name; in
the other as a coherer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">257</span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Aluminium Coherer.</span></h3>

<p>Aluminium, a metal which has steadily
grown into favor, and which is now readily
obtainable, can be made to serve in the
present apparatus in place of nickel both as
to electrodes and filings. It is advisable,
however, to use aluminium electrodes of
slightly larger diameter than those of other
metals.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Steel Ball Coherer.</span></h3>

<p>A recent writer has recommended the use
of balls of steel, such as are used in ball
bearings, such, however, not to exceed
⅜ inch diameter. Such a coherer would take
the form of an upright glass tube, with
electrodes exerting pressure on a series of
four or more steel balls. Decoherence here
becomes difficult, and mention is but made
of it to show the variety of forms which
this important little article may assume.</p>

<p>Coherers are adjusted by advancing or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">258</span>
receding the electrodes, altering the quantity
of the filings, etc. There exists but little
difficulty in operating coherers; considerable
latitude is permissible as to adjustment, size,
character, etc. There does not seem so much
difficulty in obtaining sensitiveness as in
guarding against external electrical disturbances.
Wings or vanes of thin sheet metal
are sometimes attached to the metal ends or
electrodes of the coherer for purposes of
adjustment, their size and capacity being
determined by experiment. It is best that
they present no sharp angles, but be of a disc,
or spherical, form, the better not to dissipate
energy.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Oscillator.</span></h3>

<p>This is the name given the contrivance at
the ends of the discharger, <i>D</i> being the point
at which the electrical oscillations, or waves,
are radiated.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">259</span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Clarke's Oscillator.</span></h3>

<p>This consists of two brass spheres, generally
3 inches in diameter, and mounted on
a stand or sometimes on top of the induction
coil. The distance between the balls is
readily adjustable by either attaching the
balls on the ends of two sliding rods, or
causing the balls themselves to slide on the
rods (Fig. 77).</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Triple Oscillator.</span></h3>

<p>Here three balls are used, two outside ones
connected to the circuit, being one-half inch<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">260</span>
diameter, and the middle one, isolated from
all connection, of three inches in diameter.
This form is best mounted on a separate
stand, the balls either being on glass or hard
rubber legs (Fig. 78). Connecting wires
from the secondary of the coil must in all
cases be run with the greatest precautions
against crosses, as directed in Chapter V.</p>

<p>It is possible to make many different
designs in oscillators. Some experimenters
use the simple Clarke form, others prefer
the triple balls; yet, again, others vary the
sizes and the relative sizes of the balls. One
form of oscillator prescribes the balls to be
immersed in oil or vaseline. Such methods
all have their adherents. Even the plain
points of an induction coil discharger will
serve for short-distance work.</p>

<p>Oscillators are adjusted by altering their
proximity to one another, and should have
care given to keep the spheres bright. It is
easy to alter capacity of an oscillator by
connecting its spheres to other insulated
spheres.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">261</span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Coil.</span></h3>

<p>The coil for wireless telegraphy does not
differ from the regular Ruhmkorff, except
that in place of the contact breaker a signal
or Morse telegraph key is substituted. Of
course, the contact breaker can be made to
perform the same duty by retracting the
adjusting screw out of reach of the platinum
on spring, and then operating the hammer
and spring in same manner as key.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Translating Devices.</span></h3>

<p>Under this head are included relay
sounder, bell, or register, which are at receiving
set. They do not differ from the
regular telegraphic apparatus. The sounder
may be of the Western Union pattern,
wound to 4 ohms; the relay also Western
Union pattern, and wound to 150 or 250
ohms, as best suits the individual case.</p>

<p>In order to protect the receiver from the
action of the transmitter belonging to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">262</span>
same set of instruments, particularly when
powerful waves are generated, it has been
found at times necessary to enclose the
receiver in a metal case. Marconi has patents
on such devices, particularly on a
movable shutter in the case, which opens
when the transmitter is not in operation.
Edouard Branly placed his receiving set in
a metal case with a vertical slit eight inches
by one-tenth of an inch.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Air Conductor.</span></h3>

<p>The vertical wire extending from the
coherer up into the air must be insulated
from all other objects in the best possible
manner. A bare copper wire of No. 14
B &amp; S gauge can be suspended from porcelain
insulating knobs, which in turn can be
strung from each other by means of stout
silk cord or even wire. There is a special
form of insulator used in electric construction
work, and known as a circuit breaker,
which will answer and which is easy of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">263</span>
attachment; reference to Fig. 79 will show
manner of using.</p>

</div>
<p>Temporary grounds can be made to water
pipes, but it is better to use regular
telephone copper ground-plates sunk
deep in moist earth.</p>

<p>At South Foreland, England, a
mast has been erected, 150 feet in
height for transmission across Channel,
a distance of nearly thirty miles.
At Notre Dame University, Illinois,
Professor Green used a wire 150 feet
in length, suspended from top of a
high church tower, but was unable
to transmit much over three miles,
owing, presumably, to fact that the
intervening country was well supplied
with overhead wires, which
probably intercepted the waves.</p>

<p>It has been claimed that earthed or
grounded air wires are necessary, but
balls or similar "capacities" are not of service
on the top of the wire. A theory has been
advanced that the currents do not pass from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">264</span>
air wire tip to air wire tip, but are conducted
by the varying strata of the earth. No
general confirmation is obtainable, however,
and the experimental reader will find a wide
field for research in this direction. Marconi,
on the other hand, has accomplished much
with zinc cylinders under six feet high, <i>not
grounded in any respect</i>, indeed, and he also
finds it impossible to assume a proportion
between distance of effect and height of air
wire. The following investigations and
experiments are of interest in this connection:</p>

<p>At a meeting of the Institution of Electrical
Engineers, in December, 1898, Dr.
Oliver Lodge showed that there must be
a certain relative position between the receiving
and transmitting circuits.</p>

<p>He placed on one side of a room a box,
containing a battery, bell, relay, and coherer
properly connected up. On the other side
he had an induction coil and pair of parallel
discharger rods, with a spark gap to transmit
waves across the room. When the rods<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">265</span>
of the receiver and transmitter were placed
parallel to each other the receiving bell was
operated; when the receiving rods of the
transmitter were at right angles to those of
the receiver the bell either failed to work,
or weakened very considerably. He also
told of an experiment made to determine the
influence of different methods of grounding
the apparatus. He found that when the
apparatus was connected by a wire laid on
the ground, there was the required response
at the receiving station; but when the two
stations were situated each side of a lake,
and the ground wires immersed in the
water, the receiving instrument failed to
work. It seemed to him that the conductivity
and power absorption of ether wave energy
by water was too great to allow of the
transmission of Hertz waves. This would
seem to bear out the results obtained by
Marconi in dispensing with ground wires.</p>

easy method given for forming the letters will enable a person to
form the letters correctly, and with a little practice to do so quickly.—<i>American

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org/license

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
